In this video we will cover","how you can connect with","MongoDB tools to your Azure Cosmos DB database","with the MongoDB API's.","In this video, we will be covering","the MongoDB Shell, Mongo export,","Mongo import, Mongo dump, Mongo restore,","and Robomongo as the MongoDB tools.","So getting started, we are in the Azure portal and","I'll navigate over to my Cosmos DB databases.","As you can see, I already have","anhoh-mongo already set up.","I navigate over to the Quick start,","and then to the MongoDB Shell.","For your convenience, we've added the command line for","connecting with the Mongo shell to","your Cosmos DB database.","So, I copy this over.","I'll run it in the directory,","which already has my Mongo shell, right over here.","I'll paste it and run it.","As you can see,","I'm connected, so I could show you the databases.","I can use edx, show you the collections.","Show collections, and then I can even run a simple query.","As you can see,","this has ten volcano documents and this is what","we would be using as the sample data for the export,","import, dump, and restore.","So, I will exit out of","the shell and we'll clear the screen.","Next, we'll be doing a Mongo export,","which seeks a host, doesn't it, as an argument,","and the host can be found inside connection string.","Here.
