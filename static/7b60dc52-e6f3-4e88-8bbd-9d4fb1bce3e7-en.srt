00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,760
>> Hi and welcome to Logic and Computational Thinking.

1
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,745
If you haven't gone through the course yet,

2
00:00:06,745 --> 00:00:09,350
we're really excited for you to dump into

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,765
the material and before you get started in that material,

4
00:00:12,765 --> 00:00:15,080
I wanted to spend some time here with Dr. Paul Herrick.

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,580
Thank you for joining us today Paul.

6
00:00:16,580 --> 00:00:17,290
>> Thank you, Paul.

7
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:19,280
>> Dr. Herrick's book is

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,784
the book called Think with Socrates.

9
00:00:21,784 --> 00:00:24,530
A lot of the content that you're going to experience in

10
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:27,500
the course actually comes from Paul's book.

11
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,180
So, I thought it would be a lot of fun to

12
00:00:29,180 --> 00:00:31,480
spend a few minutes just chatting with Paul.

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,730
He's had a long career teaching logic.

14
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,040
He's written a couple of textbooks and so,

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,570
I thought it'd be good to get some background.

16
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,670
Logic can be a little stodgy for

17
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,965
some people and seem very academic.

18
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:44,390
So, I thought I would give a little bit of

19
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:47,930
a human face to talk about what goes into logic.

20
00:00:47,930 --> 00:00:50,350
So, again, were are going

21
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,015
to talk a little bit about this book in a minute.

22
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:55,100
I want to talk a little bit about your career.

23
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:58,295
So you graduated from the University of Washington.

24
00:00:58,295 --> 00:00:59,645
I don't want to maybe date you here,

25
00:00:59,645 --> 00:01:01,340
but how long ago?

26
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,760
>> Quite a few years ago.

27
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,847
>> Quite a few? Good.

28
00:01:03,847 --> 00:01:04,847
>> Yeah.

29
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,330
>> So you have your Ph.D. in philosophy,

30
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,350
and you've taught philosophy and logic

31
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,160
now from many years?

32
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,660
>> 35 years.

33
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:15,140
>> Wow. You're in your thirty-fifth year. That's amazing.

34
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,590
So Paul and I have been friends

35
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:18,570
for a decade and a half, just about.

36
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,575
>> Well, I met you 18 years ago.

37
00:01:20,575 --> 00:01:21,510
>> Okay, Yes. Just about.

38
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:23,760
>> At the philosopher's talk.

39
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,320
>> That's right.

40
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:24,640
>> Yeah.

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,815
>> I remember exactly where we were.

42
00:01:27,815 --> 00:01:29,960
And so, we've been talking logic

43
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,095
and philosophy for those 18 years.

44
00:01:33,095 --> 00:01:36,585
You have two texts published, logic texts.

45
00:01:36,585 --> 00:01:38,565
One with Harcourt Brace

46
00:01:38,565 --> 00:01:40,140
was called The Many Worlds Of Logic,

47
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:41,220
which was a great book, I use

48
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,540
that in many of the courses that I taught.

49
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,855
And now, you have a new logic texted out with

50
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:48,410
Oxford University Press which is no small feet.

51
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,205
Oxford University Press is

52
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:53,575
probably the premier publisher of philosophy.

53
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:55,140
So it's quite an accomplishment

54
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,595
to get that book published.

55
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:59,545
So, let's talk about both those logic texts.

56
00:01:59,545 --> 00:02:01,290
As I look through

57
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,495
textbooks like the ones that you've written,

58
00:02:03,495 --> 00:02:06,900
I just can see an enormous amount of work there.

59
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,335
Why did you write your first logic book

60
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:11,975
or your logic text with Harcourt Brace?

61
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:18,270
>> Well, I taught logic for

62
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,615
10 or 12 years with various textbooks

63
00:02:22,615 --> 00:02:28,280
and they were wonderful books but every book I use,

64
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,470
there were features of

65
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,815
logic I wanted to include that the book didn't include

66
00:02:33,815 --> 00:02:37,980
and the textbooks that I

67
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,350
used didn't explain things as

68
00:02:40,350 --> 00:02:43,360
thoroughly as I wanted to explain them.

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,380
And a lot of students these days are so

70
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:50,035
busy that they'll attend class just a few times a week.

71
00:02:50,035 --> 00:02:52,380
And I wanted a textbook that

72
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,080
explained everything more thoroughly so

73
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,960
that a student could learn it at home and not

74
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,640
have to come to class every day.

75
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,400
And I wanted the textbook to include certain topics

76
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,400
that weren't in the books I was using.

77
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,210
So, I began writing my own.

78
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:13,050
And I spent five years

79
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:16,670
trying to incorporate modal logic

80
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:19,310
into the introductory logic textbook.

81
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:20,835
I thought this was an important branch of

82
00:03:20,835 --> 00:03:23,000
logic that isn't covered very often.

83
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,554
>> Why don't we take a quick tangent.

84
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:26,420
We don't cover modal logic in this course.

85
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,670
Can you just briefly explain what modal logic is?

86
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:31,130
>> So, modal logic is the logic

87
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,635
of possibility and necessity.

88
00:03:34,635 --> 00:03:37,490
And it turns out that a lot of

89
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,005
the great philosophical arguments

90
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:43,705
employ modal logic in their reasoning.

91
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:46,900
So it's a fascinating branch of logic.

92
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,115
It actually goes back to the beginning of the discipline.

93
00:03:50,115 --> 00:03:52,010
Aristotle, the founder of logic

94
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,320
is also the founder of modal logic.

95
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,030
But in this branch of logic,

96
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,860
philosophers study necessity and

97
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:02,430
possibility with respect to propositions.

98
00:04:02,430 --> 00:04:04,100
So propositions can be

99
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,620
necessarily true or necessarily false,

100
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,770
possibly true, possibly false,

101
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,090
with respect to properties.

102
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,620
So an entity can possess

103
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:16,545
a property necessarily or contingently.

104
00:04:16,545 --> 00:04:21,485
And with respect to existence,

105
00:04:21,485 --> 00:04:25,510
which is the most controversial part of modal logic.

106
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:29,030
But modal logicians believe that

107
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:31,370
some things can exist necessarily

108
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,115
and other things can exist on a contingent basis.

109
00:04:34,115 --> 00:04:35,815
And so, that's part of modal logic.

110
00:04:35,815 --> 00:04:38,270
So, I wanted to incorporate modal logic into

111
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,510
the introductory course and I wanted to explain

112
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:43,580
things as more thoroughly

113
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:45,950
than usual and that's what led me to write

114
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,810
my first book and I

115
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,650
developed a passion for putting everything into a system.

116
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:00,540
It was exciting to try to get all the right elements in,

117
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:04,015
in all the right places in a systematic form

118
00:05:04,015 --> 00:05:08,410
that would flow and the students would follow.

119
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,600
And so, that was exciting for me.

120
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,090
>> Is that where the title "Many Worlds" came from?

121
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:14,495
As you had all these different systems?

122
00:05:14,495 --> 00:05:16,285
>> Actually, Many Worlds of Logic

123
00:05:16,285 --> 00:05:19,100
was an illusion to modal logic.

124
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:19,327
>> I see. Okay.

125
00:05:19,327 --> 00:05:23,630
>> And I don't know if I should go into why it was,

126
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:25,840
But modal logicians refer to

127
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,600
things they call possible worlds.

128
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,380
And the semantics of

129
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,450
modal logic is all defined in terms of

130
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:37,300
theoretical entities called possible worlds.

131
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:41,416
Ways the universe could have been or could be,

132
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,945
and so, it was an allusion to that.

133
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:47,883
Very interesting aspect of modal logic.

134
00:05:47,883 --> 00:05:49,630
>> So that was a big distinguishing factor

135
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:51,250
of your book relative to other that you wrote.

136
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:52,810
>> Well, that's I think why it

137
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,490
was published because it integrated

138
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,125
modal logic into the standard logic course.

139
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,780
And as far as I know, only one other book did that.

140
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:01,040
>> Yeah.

141
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,950
>> And so, it's exciting because I could bring in

142
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:11,620
arguments about free will and about time and fatalism.

143
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:14,170
Whether their future's already been fated

144
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,790
to happen into the logic course

145
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:19,470
and develop those arguments

146
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,120
using the symbols of modal logic.

147
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,020
And that was kind of fun.

148
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,830
>> Sure.

149
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,040
>> Yes.

150
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,955
>> So, how do you do research for a book like this?

151
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:27,105
One of the questions I actually have never asked you this

152
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:29,787
personally so I can ask you now on camera.

153
00:06:29,787 --> 00:06:32,460
When you're preparing to write a book

154
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,560
like on logic or even mathematics or something like that,

155
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,995
it's been done for so many decades and centuries,

156
00:06:38,995 --> 00:06:41,330
how do you approach it uniquely?

157
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,680
Like when you're writing your examples or you're

158
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,730
writing the definition of

159
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,620
a Modus Ponens or a Modus Tones,

160
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,030
a lot of the definitions that we use in

161
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,220
this course are definitions I pulled from your book

162
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:52,620
and other logic textbooks and I couldn't

163
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,910
really reword them that much

164
00:06:53,910 --> 00:06:55,375
because it's a definition right?

165
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:57,360
Modus Ponens is what a Modal Tonens is.

166
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,190
So, how do you approach

167
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,930
the topic so that you're giving it

168
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,790
your own voice and writing it in your way and

169
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:05,490
not just copying what someone else has done?

170
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,455
>> Yeah, that's a good question.

171
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:13,080
I've always walked into the classroom without notes.

172
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,720
I've never taken notes into the classroom.

173
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,940
>> I prepare ahead of time but

174
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,950
when I walk into the classroom,

175
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:24,190
I am explaining things to students as

176
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:29,155
clearly as I can at the moment, spontaneously.

177
00:07:29,155 --> 00:07:31,870
And then, what works

178
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:34,690
in the classroom is what goes into my textbook.

179
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,460
So, for many years,

180
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,258
I taught Logic three times a day,

181
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:42,550
and I got a lot of feedback from students

182
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,740
and I used that to

183
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,340
try to explain things as clearly as I could.

184
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,895
And as I'm writing the book,

185
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:52,216
I'm thinking back on my classroom experiences,

186
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:54,957
what explanations work best,

187
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:58,995
and what parts of Logic connect with students,

188
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,955
and what parts aren't really necessary.

189
00:08:00,955 --> 00:08:02,110
Because you really have to be

190
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,120
selective when you write a textbook.

191
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,090
No textbook can cover everything.

192
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:07,800
>> Right.

193
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,225
>> Yes

194
00:08:08,225 --> 00:08:11,594
>> So, talk about your book with Oxford University Press.

195
00:08:11,594 --> 00:08:12,850
That's a very different book from

196
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,545
many worlds in some ways.

197
00:08:14,545 --> 00:08:16,255
I mean, there's obviously some overlap.

198
00:08:16,255 --> 00:08:18,460
Where were going after there?

199
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,510
>> Well, the third Logic book I

200
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:27,205
wrote was a complete revision of the previous two.

201
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:32,550
And I revised it from the ground up and

202
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:36,270
Oxford had it reviewed by a number of

203
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:40,150
teachers and liked it and published it.

204
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:46,040
I actually went further on explaining everything.

205
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,885
It ended up 800 pages,

206
00:08:49,885 --> 00:08:52,830
but I tried to explain things so

207
00:08:52,830 --> 00:08:56,483
thoroughly that a student can still be at home studying,

208
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:58,470
and would find complete explanations

209
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:00,355
of everything all the way through.

210
00:09:00,355 --> 00:09:04,140
And so, it's even more

211
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,825
explained I think than the first two books.

212
00:09:07,825 --> 00:09:10,560
The second Logic book I wrote

213
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,730
expanded the coverage into

214
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,455
a lot of Inductive Logic that wasn't in the first book.

215
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:19,700
The first book was almost all Deductive Logic.

216
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,995
The second book brought a lot of Inductive Logic in.

217
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:25,710
And then the third logic book,

218
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,760
the one you're mentioning now

219
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:29,565
called "Introduction to Logic",

220
00:09:29,565 --> 00:09:33,000
has everything from the previous

221
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,830
two but I just went through from

222
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,995
the ground up and re-explained everything.

223
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:40,080
It was really fun to try

224
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,835
to clarify even further everything I tried to say.

225
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:49,675
And I added some sections,

226
00:09:49,675 --> 00:09:52,050
some more sections that I hadn't covered.

227
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,235
>> That's great. And I like"

228
00:09:54,235 --> 00:09:56,851
Introduction to Logic" because of that,

229
00:09:56,851 --> 00:09:59,273
the latest book for with Oxford University Press.

230
00:09:59,273 --> 00:10:00,547
And in fact, throughout the course,

231
00:10:00,547 --> 00:10:02,500
if the topics that you're studying

232
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,675
and that you're reading through interest you,

233
00:10:04,675 --> 00:10:06,670
I highly recommend you take a look at

234
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:09,585
getting Dr. Herrick's "Logic" textbook.

235
00:10:09,585 --> 00:10:10,460
This book is more of

236
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,920
an introduction to critical thinking,

237
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,080
the one that we've been using in this course.

238
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,720
But Dr. Herrick's textbooks are definitely going into

239
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,990
more depth in the formal logic spaces.

240
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,940
And I think there's an e-book correct?

241
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,942
For the Oxford University Press?

242
00:10:22,942 --> 00:10:25,120
There's a digital version if you want?

243
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,910
>> Yes, both books have a e-text version.

244
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,670
>> And they're relatively inexpensive as textbooks go.

245
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,530
A lot of textbooks are in the couple hundred

246
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,110
dollar range and these are what?

247
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,583
50-60? Or something like that?

248
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:37,244
>> Yes. Around 60.

249
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:39,192
>> That's a good price.

250
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:40,930
>> Oxford is a non-profit publisher.

251
00:10:40,930 --> 00:10:41,310
>> Right.

252
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:45,280
>> And they produce quality books

253
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,440
that are quite a bit

254
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,875
less than the big commercial publishers.

255
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,860
>> And that's why I don't feel bad recommending

256
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,325
these books too.

257
00:10:54,325 --> 00:10:56,170
They're great, great texts,

258
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:58,090
one of the things about this latest book,

259
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,695
is that you can study from it on your own.

260
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:02,140
So, if you get the good foundation in

261
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:04,600
this course, "Logic computational Thinking",

262
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,790
then you can expand your studies by taking

263
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,070
Dr. Herrick's book and working through it on your own.

264
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,260
I think you can get a lot of value there.

265
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:13,795
So, let's talk a little bit about "Think with Socrates".

266
00:11:13,795 --> 00:11:15,745
"Think with Socrates" is a really fun book.

267
00:11:15,745 --> 00:11:17,285
I really enjoyed reading through it,

268
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:20,530
it covers a lot of topics very nicely,

269
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:24,760
which is why I wanted to use the book in this course.

270
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,410
We license a lot of the content from

271
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,790
Oxford University Press and

272
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:29,545
a lot of the content that's in the book,

273
00:11:29,545 --> 00:11:31,506
you'll find directly in the course.

274
00:11:31,506 --> 00:11:34,295
There's other things that are not in the course itself.

275
00:11:34,295 --> 00:11:36,385
So if you want to go and do more study,

276
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:38,620
the book is a nice option there.

277
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,270
But what gave you the idea to

278
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,100
come up with the book "Think with Socrates"?

279
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,800
And what was your goals of producing them?

280
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,650
>> Well, alongside Symbolic Logic

281
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,400
I've always taught critical thinking.

282
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:59,335
And critical thinking is a different course.

283
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:01,380
Although it's hard sometimes to

284
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,737
distinguish Logic and Critical Thinking,

285
00:12:04,737 --> 00:12:07,305
but the Critical Thinking course is

286
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:11,655
logic applied to everyday life,

287
00:12:11,655 --> 00:12:13,845
and that's one way to think of it.

288
00:12:13,845 --> 00:12:16,950
So, Critical Thinking literally means

289
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:20,700
criterial thinking or thinking by criteria.

290
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:25,298
So, criteria are standards, standards of evaluation,

291
00:12:25,298 --> 00:12:29,367
and critical thinking literally is thinking by standards,

292
00:12:29,367 --> 00:12:31,965
standards of good thinking.

293
00:12:31,965 --> 00:12:35,390
And Critical Thinking courses are

294
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,500
generally pitched towards improving

295
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,180
the reasoning abilities we use in

296
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:44,960
everyday life to make

297
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,755
them more realistic and more effective.

298
00:12:47,755 --> 00:12:50,565
So, I always taught Critical Thinking

299
00:12:50,565 --> 00:12:53,475
and Socrates always came up,

300
00:12:53,475 --> 00:12:55,620
because he's generally considered the

301
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,005
founder of critical thinking.

302
00:12:58,005 --> 00:13:00,680
He was the very first philosopher to teach

303
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:06,230
Critical Thinking as a means of improving your life,

304
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:09,680
and to give his life for teaching it.

305
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,860
Because the Athenian democracy executed him

306
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:15,950
primarily because of the critical thinking

307
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:18,980
he was teaching the citizens.

308
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,525
And so, he's considered the founder.

309
00:13:20,525 --> 00:13:24,405
But most critical thinking books, they honor Socrates,

310
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,470
they mention him, but

311
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,955
they don't build the course around him.

312
00:13:30,955 --> 00:13:36,704
And students, when they meet Socrates,

313
00:13:36,704 --> 00:13:38,060
they fall in love with him.

314
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:43,095
He's a remarkable human being, a remarkable character,

315
00:13:43,095 --> 00:13:48,725
he's so inspiring and I fell in love with Socrates

316
00:13:48,725 --> 00:13:51,900
and the idea came to

317
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,670
me to build a critical thinking course

318
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:55,550
around his persona.

319
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:59,704
That was sort of what led me to write the book.

320
00:13:59,704 --> 00:14:06,143
The book introduces students to Socrates, his person,

321
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:09,200
his life, his method of thought,

322
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,120
and then the whole rest of the book

323
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,993
builds on that and refers back to him.

324
00:14:13,993 --> 00:14:16,765
And so the course is built around a person,

325
00:14:16,765 --> 00:14:18,790
but a remarkable person.

326
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:24,205
A person who sometime in the middle of his life

327
00:14:24,205 --> 00:14:28,450
realized that a lot of people think they know what

328
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:32,910
they're talking about when they haven't a clue.

329
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,520
They think they're an expert in

330
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,260
things then they really

331
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,435
have no idea what they're talking about.

332
00:14:38,435 --> 00:14:43,850
And he could have

333
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:46,740
just grab people by the collar and shook them,

334
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,978
he could have been angry,

335
00:14:49,978 --> 00:14:51,920
but he had so much respect for

336
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,110
the individual and so much love

337
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:56,675
of his fellow human beings,

338
00:14:56,675 --> 00:14:59,060
that he couldn't be

339
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,190
harsh with people and yell at them and shake them.

340
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:05,735
His method turned out to be different.

341
00:15:05,735 --> 00:15:09,312
He asked people questions,

342
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:12,880
but they were questions designed to cause people to look

343
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,520
in the mirror and examine their own assumptions,

344
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,130
and find out for themselves where they were going wrong.

345
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:24,860
>> Right. And it's become known as the Socratic method.

346
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,925
>> That is the Socratic method.

347
00:15:26,925 --> 00:15:28,130
I would put it this way,

348
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:29,465
looking in the mirror,

349
00:15:29,465 --> 00:15:32,720
and evaluating your assumptions and

350
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,805
your actions on the basis of realistic criteria.

351
00:15:37,805 --> 00:15:42,845
Criteria related to truth and justice.

352
00:15:42,845 --> 00:15:46,985
And he gave his life for that vision,

353
00:15:46,985 --> 00:15:51,615
the vision of a life in which a person

354
00:15:51,615 --> 00:15:54,885
constantly examines his assumptions

355
00:15:54,885 --> 00:15:57,270
is willing to admit he's wrong,

356
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:02,190
is willing to correct his actions and his views.

357
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:05,760
And so that became known as Critical Thinking.

358
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,490
And so, I wanted to organize

359
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:12,210
the book around that human vision, really.

360
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:15,595
>> Yes. And it really turned out to be a great result.

361
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:17,970
When we think about "Logic and Computational Thinking",

362
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:19,590
and applying logical principles

363
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,165
to writing computer programs,

364
00:16:21,165 --> 00:16:23,070
there's a direct relationship between

365
00:16:23,070 --> 00:16:25,050
the formal logic, the deductive reasoning,

366
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,825
inductive reasoning,

367
00:16:26,825 --> 00:16:28,170
the categorical reasoning that

368
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:29,625
we talk about in the course.

369
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:32,220
But there's a whole aspect of working with other people,

370
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,620
and working in a business or a corporation,

371
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,446
or selling your work, that

372
00:16:36,446 --> 00:16:39,345
takes those logical concepts and applies them to life.

373
00:16:39,345 --> 00:16:41,390
And I think that we try to bring out

374
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:43,895
some of those topics as well in the course.

375
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:45,480
And you certainly do a great job

376
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,480
of relating kind of logic to real life.

377
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,070
Right? Logic can be fairly

378
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,405
academic and a little bit stodgy sometimes.

379
00:16:52,405 --> 00:16:53,700
But you do a really good job of showing.

380
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,400
There's a huge practical side to

381
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,020
this discipline and taking

382
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,370
those concepts and applying them to a real problems.

383
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:02,190
>> Thank you. Yes. Well, once you're

384
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:07,335
aware of the nature of critical thinking,

385
00:17:07,335 --> 00:17:10,395
you're looking at the criteria.

386
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:13,965
And if you're in an organization

387
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:16,530
and decisions are being made and you're

388
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:19,245
part of the decision-making process,

389
00:17:19,245 --> 00:17:21,240
you can look at the criteria

390
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,550
that are being used and you can ask,

391
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:26,715
"Are these criteria appropriate for the goal?

392
00:17:26,715 --> 00:17:27,900
For our goal?

393
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,138
Are these criteria grounded in reality?

394
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:32,170
Are these criteria realistic?"

395
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:33,445
You can ask questions like that.

396
00:17:33,445 --> 00:17:35,290
That's what a critical thinker does.

397
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:37,080
And so, once you're aware of

398
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:39,345
the way critical thinking works,

399
00:17:39,345 --> 00:17:43,880
it can be a tool that you use in an organization,

400
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,320
in a group, as well as just in your own personal life.

401
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,556
>> That's right.

402
00:17:48,556 --> 00:17:53,980
>> So, yes. That's great.

403
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,675
>> Well, thanks. Thanks, Paul.

404
00:17:55,675 --> 00:17:57,790
It was nice to hear a little bit about the textbooks,

405
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,305
and then of course about "Think with Socrates"

406
00:18:00,305 --> 00:18:03,915
which has been a fantastic asset to our course.

407
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:05,230
What we'll do in the next video,

408
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,975
is talk a little bit about how

409
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:09,850
logic can be applied to real-world problems.

410
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:11,050
We'll talk a little bit about some of

411
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,520
the challenges that students face

412
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:15,288
when they just first start studying logic,

413
00:18:15,288 --> 00:18:16,600
and we'll explore those topics

414
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,670
a little bit in the next video. We'll see you there.

415
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,450
>> Thank you.
