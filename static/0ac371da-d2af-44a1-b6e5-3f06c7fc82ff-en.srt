00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,090
In this video I'm going to walk you through

1
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:05,040
using Venn diagrams to test two

2
00:00:05,070 --> 00:00:08,130
arguments for validity. So I've got

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,120
a couple arguments that we're going to

4
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,950
look at we'll start obviously with this

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,200
first one here that's on screen and to

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,040
begin we're going to draw our diagram

7
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,270
we're going to draw three overlapping circles to begin

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,600
the process of testing these arguments

9
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:25,140
for validity. And as we look at the--

10
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:26,490
argument we need to indicate

11
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:28,740
which circles represent which terms so

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,260
we're going to start with the second term

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,750
in the conclusion first and we indicate

14
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,940
that on the lower right circle, so we'll

15
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,670
put our poets, P there for poets

16
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,370
and then we use the middle term which shows

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,530
up in the second premise in the

18
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,050
conclusion and so we'll put logicians

19
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,570
here in the bottom right and then our

20
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,620
our first term the scientists we're

21
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:53,890
going to indicate on the top circle here.

22
00:00:53,950 --> 00:00:55,820
Alright now we've got all of our

23
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,000
circles and they're labeled

24
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,640
appropriately so we want to start to

25
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,980
look at the argument and fill in

26
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:04,000
and represent those premises in the diagram itself.

27
00:01:04,088 --> 00:01:06,960
So we'll start with the universal

28
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:08,820
statement so out of the two premises the

29
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,560
first premise obviously is the universal

30
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:12,930
statement, No scientists are poets and we

31
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,490
need to fill then and we'll look at the

32
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:17,310
areas in this on the both circles where

33
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,100
scientists and poets overlap

34
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:21,720
and remember we're going to fill in areas

35
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,390
for negative statements. So since it says

36
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,750
no scientists are poets, we're going to color

37
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,340
in this area here where the two overlap

38
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,250
which indicates that this is a null area

39
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,400
and Not this represent also no or not statement.

40
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,360
So this essentially says that

41
00:01:37,410 --> 00:01:39,420
the area between scientists and poets

42
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,340
indicates that there's nothing in that

43
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,150
space, it's a null area and so that represents

44
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:47,360
that universal not statement.

45
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,000
And then the second premise is obviously a

46
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,110
particular statement says some

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,850
scientists are logicians remember some

48
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,460
means at least one, so we're going to put

49
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:59,640
an X in the area between the circle for

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,220
scientists in the circle for logicians,

51
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:04,860
and we'll put that X right there. So now

52
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,320
we have our two premises represented into

53
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,810
test the argument for validity we

54
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:11,580
have to look at the conclusion and see

55
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,640
if the Venn diagram does adequately

56
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,220
represent the conclusion, so our

57
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,970
conclusion is somewhat logicians are not

58
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:22,860
poets and so we're going to look at the

59
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,140
area between logicians and poets the

60
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,330
circles were those over the areas of the

61
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,450
circles were those overlap. And we can

62
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,780
see that we're going to focus on this

63
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,110
area here. Now the conclusion says some

64
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:36,420
logicians are not poets and you can see

65
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,990
that in that area that we write circled

66
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,430
here in green there is half of that area

67
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,700
where that's nulled out. So that does it

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,040
seem to indicate that the conclusion

69
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,950
is true, some logicians are not poets.

70
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,310
So based on the diagram we've now validated

71
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,480
that this is a valid argument

72
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,680
and so the Venn diagram has shown us

73
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:01,980
that this is valid. Okay, and we did that

74
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,470
simply by filling in the areas for the premises on our diagram

75
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,600
and then looking at the conclusion and hence we've conclusion is

76
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,140
represented by that diagram.

77
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:16,700
Okay! Now, let's look at our second one, Some actors are sculptors.

78
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,020
Some poets are not actors.

79
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,150
So, some poets are not sculptors, so let's go ahead

80
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,270
and start by creating our circles again.

81
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:29,530
And we'll go ahead and label those as well. We'll start with sculptors

82
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:34,990
here, put that down in the lower-- the lower right

83
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,860
and we'll put poets here in the lower left

84
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,140
and then actors at the top. Okay, since both

85
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,520
premises are particular statements it doesn't matter which when we start with.

86
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,990
We'll start with premise 1 and this essentially says-- this says that

87
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,050
some actors are not sculptors. So we're going put this in

88
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,990
ah, sorry, some actors are sculptors. We're going put our X in the

89
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,030
area between actors and sculptors.

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,070
But, since we don't know which side of this area we want to put our X

91
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:08,290
we have to straddle the line between the space between

92
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,730
the area that overlaps actors and sculptors.

93
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,310
So, we're going to stick our X there, if we put our X in either side

94
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,150
of that circle, we're going to over commit. We're going to state something

95
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,680
more than what the premise states, so we want to stick it in the on the line

96
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,400
there. So we don't overstate in the diagram what stated in the premises.

97
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,730
And then we're going to do the same thing for premise 2.

98
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,040
Some poets are not actors and well

99
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,800
because there's a couple of different places we could put it

100
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,000
and we don't know which one we're going go ahead

101
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,040
and stick that on the line just like that. So, now we have our

102
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:46,000
premises represented in the diagram itself and now we need to look

103
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:50,720
at our conclusion which says so some poets are not sculptors

104
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,680
and we have to see if that's represented in the diagram.

105
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,940
And because there's no areas that are nulled out, there's no areas

106
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,280
we filled in indicating a null area, then we can

107
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,100
conclude that this argument is invalid because the conclusion

108
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,600
is not represented in the argument itself.

109
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:12,960
So this is an invalid argument. OK!

110
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,800
So, we used our Venn diagrams here to show that the arguments

111
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:21,040
one argument is valid and one an argument is invalid

112
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:24,960
simply by representing the content of the premises

113
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:28,640
in the diagram itself and then seeing if that diagram represents

114
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:32,160
the content of the conclusion. In one case it did here

115
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,440
and then in the second case it did not. So one argument is valid

116
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,860
and one arg is invalid. And that's how you can use a Venn diagram

117
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,910
to test arguments for validity.
