00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,115
>> Hey and welcome back. I'm here with Dr. Paul Herrick.

1
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:06,835
Dr. Herrick is the author of the book

2
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:08,470
"Think with Socrates" published

3
00:00:08,470 --> 00:00:10,380
by Oxford University Press.

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,590
And this text is

5
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,120
the book that we've been using in our course.

6
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,010
A lot of the material and

7
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,255
the exercises and the exam questions that you are

8
00:00:19,255 --> 00:00:22,810
working your way through are taken from

9
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,340
this book along with a bunch of

10
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,665
other supplementary material that we put together.

11
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:28,570
So Dr. Herrick authored that book,

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,858
and it's been a pleasure to have him in the studio,

13
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:34,150
and chatting with him a little bit in earlier modules.

14
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:35,440
We've recorded a couple of

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,180
videos that you probably want to check out.

16
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,950
We had a good conversation about Logic,

17
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,245
and the textbooks, and those kinds of things.

18
00:00:41,245 --> 00:00:42,430
So before you get into

19
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,830
the sections and deductive and inductive reasoning,

20
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:46,660
I thought it would be helpful to talk with Dr.

21
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:49,000
Herrick on some of these topics.

22
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,860
You're going to run into some things that may be a little

23
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:53,440
confusing and a little counter-intuitive.

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,520
So, I thought it would be good to have

25
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,920
a conversation to talk about what you're going to see

26
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,170
in these upcoming modules

27
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:00,580
and talk about ways that you can get

28
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,845
past some of the challenges that

29
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,600
you may encounter as

30
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,280
you are working through the material.

31
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,780
Dr. Herrick has taught Logic in

32
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,980
the classroom and online for 35 years.

33
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:12,430
I've only been teaching for about half that, so,

34
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:15,147
I thought it'd be good to get a veteran, educator,

35
00:01:15,147 --> 00:01:16,490
person that study this material

36
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,400
wrote three different Logic textbooks

37
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,515
and "Think with Socrates"

38
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:22,880
to talk you through some of these challenges.

39
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,070
So, we're going to look through

40
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,960
some slides that you had prepared ahead of time.

41
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,220
Can you talk a little bit about what's

42
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,270
on these slides and what

43
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,740
your goals were in putting these slides

44
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,360
together to help these students?

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,370
>> Sure. So, I have

46
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,950
some slides that are designed to give you

47
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:38,410
a quick little lesson on

48
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:41,885
how Logic can help you reason better.

49
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:46,590
So, these are just a few examples of arguments that

50
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,330
seem valid or seem reasonable at first glance,

51
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,640
but after you've studied Logic and

52
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,145
thought about the principles of Logic,

53
00:01:56,145 --> 00:01:58,270
you can spot the problems.

54
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:01,045
So, I have a few examples to illustrate.

55
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:03,360
>> Great. So, when we're talking prior to doing

56
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:06,440
this recording about validity and deduction,

57
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,150
so you actually wrote a little example here that we're

58
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,470
going to take a quick look at

59
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:11,966
so you can help the student understand.

60
00:02:11,966 --> 00:02:13,500
What are we going to be talking through?

61
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,345
What are we looking here on the screen?

62
00:02:15,345 --> 00:02:18,669
>> Okay. So, logicians,

63
00:02:18,669 --> 00:02:21,510
what you'll learn in Paul's course

64
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:25,050
is that logicians starting with Aristotle,

65
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,550
the founder of Logic,

66
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:29,786
divide all arguments into two categories.

67
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:35,890
Every argument is either deductive or inductive.

68
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:38,850
In deductive arguments,

69
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:42,760
tried to show that their conclusion must be true.

70
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,480
In other words, they aim to establish

71
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,225
their conclusion with complete certainty.

72
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:53,835
They attempt to conclusively prove their conclusion true.

73
00:02:53,835 --> 00:02:57,293
Inductive arguments, on the other hand,

74
00:02:57,293 --> 00:02:59,070
attempt to show their conclusion is

75
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,880
probably true but not certain.

76
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:05,670
So they aim for a little bit lower standard,

77
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:09,507
they aim to show the conclusion is likely probable,

78
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:12,660
reasonable, but not completely certain.

79
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:16,150
So, induction aims at probability but not certainty,

80
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,095
deduction aims at complete certainty.

81
00:03:19,095 --> 00:03:25,365
Now, what we have here is an argument because the word

82
00:03:25,365 --> 00:03:30,040
"Therefore" is a conclusion indicator word

83
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,940
indicating a conclusion is about to be given.

84
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,385
So this word here tells us we have an argument.

85
00:03:36,385 --> 00:03:38,334
And then, this word here,

86
00:03:38,334 --> 00:03:41,360
it's called a "Deductive indicator word".

87
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,730
This word tells us that

88
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,340
the argument is deductive in nature.

89
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,515
So the claim here is that,

90
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:50,230
if the premises are true,

91
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,555
the conclusion must be true.

92
00:03:52,555 --> 00:03:55,150
Because necessarily means must

93
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:57,405
be so, cannot be otherwise.

94
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,720
>> And that definition you gave us

95
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,220
is the definition of validity.

96
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,540
And again, we're going to talk about this in

97
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,355
more detail in the course itself,

98
00:04:03,355 --> 00:04:05,303
but that's what "Validity" means.

99
00:04:05,303 --> 00:04:06,931
Assuming the premises are true,

100
00:04:06,931 --> 00:04:08,630
the conclusion must follow with an assessment.

101
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,087
>> Yes. I'll add one thing to that.

102
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,310
What makes an argument deductive

103
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:20,260
is that it aims to show that its conclusion must be true.

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:24,820
If a deductive argument succeeds in its aim,

105
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:28,750
we call it a "Valid Deductive Argument" So this is

106
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:30,700
deductive because the aim is to

107
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,430
show that the conclusion must be true.

108
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:36,190
It is a "Valid Deductive Argument".

109
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:38,890
So I'll write, it is valid

110
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,330
because it does indeed succeed in its aim.

111
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:45,340
If the premises are true,

112
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,760
the conclusion must indeed be true just as claimed.

113
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:52,810
Now, you can think this through in your head.

114
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:56,869
If all cats are mammals, if that's true,

115
00:04:56,869 --> 00:05:01,735
and if all mammals are animals, if that's true,

116
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:06,875
then it necessarily follows that all cats are animals.

117
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,905
And you can think it through with a little diagram.

118
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:12,125
We could let that circle

119
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:16,700
represent all the cats in the universe.

120
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,780
We can let this circle

121
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:21,650
represent all the mammals in the universe.

122
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:25,690
And this circle inside this circle

123
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,925
simply says that all the cats

124
00:05:27,925 --> 00:05:30,445
belong to the mammal category.

125
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:35,780
So then, if we draw the animal category this way,

126
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:40,820
this says all the mammals belong to the animal category.

127
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:44,060
And so this lets us visually see

128
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,955
the relationship between the premises and the conclusion.

129
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:49,374
And that relationship is that,

130
00:05:49,374 --> 00:05:51,155
if the premises are true,

131
00:05:51,155 --> 00:05:53,685
the conclusion has to be true.

132
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:54,890
That is if all cats are

133
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,035
mammals and all mammals are animals,

134
00:05:57,035 --> 00:05:58,670
then it has to follow.

135
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:02,695
It must be so that all cats are animals.

136
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,090
So this is this is a "Valid Deductive Argument".

137
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:07,940
>> Right. And we're going to look more closely at

138
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:11,185
exactly this in the categorical section of this course.

139
00:06:11,185 --> 00:06:12,950
And we use a different type of diagram called a

140
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:15,120
"Venn Diagram" to illustrate the same thing.

141
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,250
So you'll get to practice some

142
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,930
of these and learn how to do it yourself.

143
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:21,050
>> Now, logicians will add one thing to this.

144
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,655
A student will often say,

145
00:06:23,655 --> 00:06:27,498
what makes an argument valid? Why is it valid?

146
00:06:27,498 --> 00:06:31,391
What makes it valid? And logicians will answer that,

147
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:36,184
what makes this argument valid is not its subject matter,

148
00:06:36,184 --> 00:06:38,965
what it's about, cats and mammals and animals.

149
00:06:38,965 --> 00:06:41,710
What makes it valid is what logicians

150
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,795
called the logical form of the argument.

151
00:06:44,795 --> 00:06:48,130
This argument has a abstract structure

152
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:51,252
called a "Logical Form".

153
00:06:51,252 --> 00:06:53,460
It's a structure that many different arguments about

154
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:57,480
many different things could fit or follow.

155
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:00,345
And so, it's that abstract form

156
00:07:00,345 --> 00:07:02,655
or structure that makes this valid,

157
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,596
not what it's about.

158
00:07:04,596 --> 00:07:06,090
So what we do is we distinguish

159
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,010
the form from the content.

160
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,965
So the form of this argument is,

161
00:07:10,965 --> 00:07:15,540
all A's are B's,

162
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:19,275
where A and B are categories of things.

163
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:26,150
All B are C, and therefore,

164
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,500
all A are C. So,

165
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:33,925
this is called the logical form of the argument,

166
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:36,650
where the A and the B and the C are variables standing

167
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:40,837
for the words that stand for categories of things,

168
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:44,625
cat's, mammals and animals.

169
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,520
So this is purely abstract.

170
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:49,430
It's not about anything in particular, whereas,

171
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,490
this argument is about animals.

172
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,500
>> Correct.

173
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,850
>> So that we talk about the content of

174
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:59,855
the argument versus logical form of the argument,

175
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,745
and it's the form that makes this valid.

176
00:08:02,745 --> 00:08:04,880
And then what Logic teaches you to do,

177
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,955
is it teaches you how to see the form above the content.

178
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,930
How to abstract the Form from

179
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,430
the Content and see whether it's a valid form or not.

180
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,685
That's a valid form.

181
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:18,470
>> And don't worry if you're not getting this at

182
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,100
this point in the course,

183
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,825
we're going to walk through all of this in

184
00:08:21,825 --> 00:08:23,390
very specific details so you'll

185
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:25,315
learn how to recognize these.

186
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:27,170
What we're talking about here is

187
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,380
what logic will do for you.

188
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:31,280
And as you move through these lessons,

189
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,900
if you get stuck and you're

190
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,670
trying to figure out how this all works,

191
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:36,350
I think what Paul has explained is

192
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,110
the relationship between the Content and the Form.

193
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,503
And you'll see this as we

194
00:08:40,503 --> 00:08:42,710
build the concepts out

195
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:45,200
through the next couple of modules.

196
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,940
So, in the next video,

197
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,230
what we're going to do is talk you

198
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,365
through fallacies of reasoning,

199
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:55,910
where the argument may appear valid but students

200
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,340
actually go wrong on it because

201
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,205
it has an appearance that's different from the reality.

202
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:02,720
So Paul is going to talk us through

203
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,580
a couple of these forms and

204
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,510
explain why they might appear to be valid but in reality,

205
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,710
they're not valid at all.

206
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:12,540
So we'll do that in the next video. Thanks.
