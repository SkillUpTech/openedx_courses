00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,560
>> Hi and welcome back.

1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,360
I've been talking with Dr. Paul Herrick,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,370
the author of the textbook that we've been

3
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,950
using in this course, Think With Socrates.

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,390
In the last video, we talked

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,370
a little bit about logical structure,

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,465
deductive reasoning,

7
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:14,940
validity and the relationship

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,210
between content and structure.

9
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:19,170
And we're giving you

10
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:20,850
this content now prior

11
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,260
to you getting into the lesson so you

12
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,480
can be prepared for the stuff that you're

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,560
going to be learning in the next couple of modules.

14
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:28,740
So what you might do is, as we

15
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,450
walk through the next set of slides,

16
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,700
as you're working through the lessons, if you get stuck,

17
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,215
come back and review this because I think

18
00:00:34,215 --> 00:00:36,255
once you start getting into the material,

19
00:00:36,255 --> 00:00:37,440
a lot of what we're going to talk about

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,080
here is going to make a lot of sense.

21
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,980
But what we want to do now is walk you through

22
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,410
some examples of deductive reasoning,

23
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,030
where students tend to

24
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:46,500
look at arguments that we're going to show you

25
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,770
and they get the- they evaluate them in the wrong way.

26
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,210
And Dr. Herrick's going to talk

27
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:52,965
a little bit about why that happens,

28
00:00:52,965 --> 00:00:55,350
and how you can actually work through looking at

29
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,755
these arguments and kind of land on the right answers.

30
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:00,540
So, some of the stuff that you're going to see in here,

31
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,065
you will see on assessments.

32
00:01:02,065 --> 00:01:03,630
So it's going to be worth your while to take

33
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,220
some time and make sure you understand this,

34
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,780
so that when you get to the assessments,

35
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:07,950
you can do a better job of

36
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:10,210
evaluating how you need to answer those questions.

37
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:11,220
So why don't we jump in we've got

38
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,860
a couple of slides here.

39
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:14,910
The slides are put together by Dr. Herrick

40
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,560
earlier and he's going to talk you through

41
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,395
some of these examples. So what's going on here?

42
00:01:18,395 --> 00:01:23,130
>> Okay, so the slides that we're about to look at,

43
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:25,890
I chose because I think they show how

44
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,780
the study of logic can improve your reasoning.

45
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,000
>> Yes.

46
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,390
>> So, when students first look at an argument like this,

47
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:38,065
before they've studied logic,

48
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:43,240
their first guess is that the reasoning looks correct.

49
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:47,600
And it does on the surface appear to be correct.

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,440
"No birds are fish" and "No cats are birds", well,

51
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,125
it's true that "No cats are fish"

52
00:01:56,125 --> 00:02:03,790
and it just looks correct to students at first.

53
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,804
It actually is an invalid argument

54
00:02:08,804 --> 00:02:10,830
but it's not obvious so

55
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,290
we have to apply some principles of logic.

56
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:16,290
Aristotle actually developed a system of

57
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,725
logic that was very mathematical in nature,

58
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:21,930
and by using that system of logic,

59
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,020
he could actually show that this was invalid.

60
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,060
But this is not a valid argument,

61
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,895
meaning, the premises by themselves.

62
00:02:32,895 --> 00:02:37,680
The information content of their premises all by itself,

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,710
does not conclusively establish the conclusion.

64
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,720
>> But these facts seem correct.

65
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,310
"No birds", it's true that no birds.

66
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,330
It is true that "No cats are birds."

67
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:46,266
>> It's true.

68
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:47,260
>> So why is this invalid?

69
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,855
It doesn't- may not make sense.

70
00:02:48,855 --> 00:02:51,690
>> Yeah. So this is an example of an argument

71
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,925
that has true premises and a true conclusion.

72
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,380
And yet, it's not correct reasoning, it's not valid.

73
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:00,420
So let's think about it. When we say

74
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,930
that no birds are fish,

75
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,930
we're telling you that there are

76
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,050
no birds in the fish category.

77
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:14,100
But we're not telling you that there's

78
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,910
no- we're not telling

79
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:19,687
you that there are no cats in the fish category.

80
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:21,350
We're not saying anything about

81
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,960
cats in this very first premise.

82
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,113
>> Correct.

83
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:25,430
>> Okay, now,

84
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:28,190
the second premise says there are no cats in

85
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,070
the bird category but that

86
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,665
doesn't tell us anything about the fish category,

87
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:35,760
if you think about it.

88
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,710
>> So the terms aren't relating to each

89
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,725
other properly in

90
00:03:38,725 --> 00:03:39,950
the premises, is that what you're saying?

91
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,520
>> Correct. They're not related

92
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,500
to- just because there's no birds that

93
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,100
are fish and there's no cats that are birds,

94
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,525
it does not follow.

95
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:53,440
It's not conclusively proven that no cats are fish.

96
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,600
So this is an example of an invalid argument.

97
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,070
>> So the point is that even though

98
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,415
these are stating true facts,

99
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:02,600
they are not related to each

100
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,760
other in the right way to draw this conclusion.

101
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:05,840
It doesn't make these facts

102
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,430
false doesn't make the statements false.

103
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:10,190
It just means that you can't get to

104
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,925
this statement by believing these two are true.

105
00:04:12,925 --> 00:04:14,450
And again, we're going to work through

106
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:16,250
this process and the rest of the lessons in

107
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,110
these modules and I'll try to

108
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:20,270
show you why that's the case,

109
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,770
and we'll use material from your book

110
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,265
to kind of illustrate this.

111
00:04:23,265 --> 00:04:24,320
But we're trying to show you is

112
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,455
that when you first read this,

113
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:26,825
if you saw this on a test,

114
00:04:26,825 --> 00:04:28,605
you might say yes, that's a valid argument.

115
00:04:28,605 --> 00:04:31,010
While it's structurally invalid even

116
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,735
though the facts that are being stated are true.

117
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:36,420
>> Now, I'll give an example to show.

118
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,330
Paul you said something very important,

119
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:41,895
its structure- it's structurally invalid.

120
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:43,970
Validity and invalidity are due

121
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:46,235
to the form of an argument.

122
00:04:46,235 --> 00:04:49,100
The structure, not to the content or not to what

123
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,450
the arguments are about which we

124
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:52,070
talked about in the previous video.

125
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:52,340
>> Yeah.

126
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:55,795
>> So let me give you a parallel argument.

127
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:58,085
This argument is going to have the same structure,

128
00:04:58,085 --> 00:05:00,200
the same form, and you're going to

129
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,960
see that it's clearly not good reasoning.

130
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,410
So, should I erase this?

131
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:07,510
>> Yeah, you can go ahead and erase that.

132
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:12,225
>> Okay, so when I started teaching,

133
00:05:12,225 --> 00:05:15,640
we used chalk and blackboards.

134
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,895
So let's look at this parallel argument.

135
00:05:18,895 --> 00:05:24,740
"No Microsoft employees-" I'm going to

136
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:34,180
make some room here, "-collect stamps. "

137
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:55,623
"No stamp collectors are artists."

138
00:05:55,623 --> 00:06:12,512
"So, necessarily, no Microsoft employees-"

139
00:06:12,512 --> 00:06:16,200
do Microsoft employees mind being called, MS employees?

140
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,840
>> Yes, that's totally fine. That's appropriate.

141
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:23,755
>> Microsoft Employees are artists.

142
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:27,680
Now, if you examine this,

143
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,120
this argument has the same

144
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,385
logical structure as this argument.

145
00:06:31,385 --> 00:06:34,800
Except we've substituted Microsoft employees.

146
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,815
Well, I'm sorry, we've substituted

147
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:40,065
Microsoft employees for cats.

148
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:44,060
And we substituted stamp collectors

149
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,605
for birds and so forth.

150
00:06:46,605 --> 00:06:48,835
Otherwise, the abstract structure is the same.

151
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:51,085
In other words, the logical form is the same.

152
00:06:51,085 --> 00:06:54,340
Now, obviously the premises

153
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:57,530
do not establish the conclusion with certainty.

154
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:57,880
>> Right.

155
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,370
>> It's possible the conclusion is true,

156
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:02,050
but the premises don't prove it.

157
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,470
>> Right.

158
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,165
>> "No stamp collectors or artists."

159
00:07:06,165 --> 00:07:08,450
Suppose that's true.

160
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,440
And suppose "No Microsoft

161
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,185
employees are stamp collectors."

162
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,550
That would not prove that

163
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,400
no Microsoft employees are artists.

164
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,750
>> Right, even though

165
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,640
all three statements could be true-.

166
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,660
>> Could be true.

167
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,190
>> You can't get to the conclusion

168
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:26,010
from this two statements.

169
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,375
>> Yes. And in terms of information theory,

170
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,990
the information content of the premises by

171
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,925
itself doesn't include

172
00:07:33,925 --> 00:07:36,490
the information content to the conclusion.

173
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,710
>> Correct.

174
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:40,810
>> So this isn't- both of these arguments are

175
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,995
invalid because they instantiate,

176
00:07:43,995 --> 00:07:47,445
as you will learn, an invalid form.

177
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:49,545
Anyway, the point I was making is,

178
00:07:49,545 --> 00:07:51,850
before students have studied logic,

179
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,650
they'll look at an argument like

180
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,155
this and it looks valid to them

181
00:07:56,155 --> 00:07:58,810
until they learn some logic and think

182
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,010
about it more critically and they

183
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:01,560
realize that's not correct reasoning.

184
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,080
>> Right. Can I get to that conclusion from the premise.

185
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,720
Again, we will look at all these terms,

186
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,185
look at these concepts and how you can arrive at

187
00:08:08,185 --> 00:08:11,233
the right conclusion using the proper reasoning,

188
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:12,325
as we move throughout the course.

189
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,360
Let's look at another example.

190
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:13,740
>> Okay.

191
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,060
>> If I can make that happen.

192
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,980
Let's see, there we go. Okay, so this

193
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,930
is a similar situation but-.

194
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:20,480
>> Similar.

195
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:20,730
>> Yeah.

196
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,195
>> Yeah. So again,

197
00:08:22,195 --> 00:08:26,140
the form of the argument is the problem.

198
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,555
It's not the content, it's the form.

199
00:08:28,555 --> 00:08:32,095
The form is, "Some A are B,"

200
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,330
where A and B are categories of

201
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,610
things or names of categories of things.

202
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,780
Well, here's what I'm going to do.

203
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:47,400
I'm going to rearrange these letters,

204
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,034
some A are B.

205
00:08:49,034 --> 00:08:58,005
And then, some B are C. And the form concludes.

206
00:08:58,005 --> 00:09:01,095
So and therefore meaning the same thing.

207
00:09:01,095 --> 00:09:05,040
So some A areC.

208
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,335
Now students before they've studied logic,

209
00:09:09,335 --> 00:09:12,346
will look at this and it looks okay.

210
00:09:12,346 --> 00:09:15,920
And explain Paul why it's not okay.

211
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,690
>> Again, for the same reason that we

212
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:20,575
saw in the last argument.

213
00:09:20,575 --> 00:09:24,080
While these statements can be true.

214
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,660
>> Probably aren't true.

215
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,925
>> You cannot use the truth of these statements

216
00:09:28,925 --> 00:09:32,330
to arrive at the truth of this statement.

217
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:34,880
So if you just look at the truth of the statement,

218
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,960
you might say, yeah, that seems like

219
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,550
a good argument. That's a valid argument.

220
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:39,185
It's a valid form.

221
00:09:39,185 --> 00:09:40,930
You might not say that until you studied logic.

222
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,860
But, you would look at this and say,

223
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,886
I would think this is okay.

224
00:09:43,886 --> 00:09:45,770
I would give it a check mark. Looks okay.

225
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:46,480
>> On the surface.

226
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,850
>> Correct.

227
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:50,900
But if in an argument what you're trying to do is

228
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,135
arrive at the truth of this statement

229
00:09:53,135 --> 00:09:55,700
by believing the truth of these true two statements,

230
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,275
and you can't do that with this form.

231
00:09:57,275 --> 00:10:00,320
>> Yeah. And now, even if these are true,

232
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,340
even if that's true,

233
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,340
and that's true, that by itself does not prove.

234
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,070
>> Correct.

235
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,960
>> That this must be true.

236
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,500
>> And that's worth an argument.

237
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,960
>> Which is what it necessarily means.

238
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,930
>> That's exactly right.

239
00:10:09,930 --> 00:10:12,330
>> That doesn't prove this must be true.

240
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,060
>> Now, we would encourage you

241
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,800
to pause the video and look at this argument

242
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,970
and see if you can see

243
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,475
intuitively before you've learned the principles,

244
00:10:19,475 --> 00:10:21,620
why you cannot arrive at

245
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,030
the necessary truth of

246
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:25,010
this statement by believing those are true.

247
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,615
Just look at it and you'll be able to see that

248
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:30,230
the conclusion does not

249
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:33,150
follow from one end to which other premises.

250
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,360
>> May I suggest a counter example?

251
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:35,590
>> Sure.

252
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,210
>> Okay. So logicians call

253
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:41,810
an argument a counterexample to an argument if

254
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,890
it shows that the target argument

255
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,570
is improper or illogical.

256
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,685
Here's a counterexample.

257
00:10:50,685 --> 00:10:53,400
Suppose I say,

258
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,830
some programmers, is it okay if I pick on programmers?

259
00:10:57,830 --> 00:11:01,650
>> Yeah. We're used to get picked on.

260
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:05,570
>> Some programmers are magicians

261
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:09,350
>> I think most

262
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,610
of the programmers in the audience would

263
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:12,250
say all programmers are magicians.

264
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,555
>> Well actually, it's magic what they do because

265
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:17,710
most people would find it magical.

266
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:18,076
>> Yeah, that's true.

267
00:11:18,076 --> 00:11:22,205
>> Okay. Some programmers are magicians,

268
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:31,043
some magicians collect stamps.

269
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:35,210
Did you know that stamp collecting is a worldwide hobby?

270
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:35,750
>> I did not know that.

271
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:36,690
>> It is worldwide.

272
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:37,290
>> Wow.

273
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,805
>> Yeah. Okay. Some programmers are magicians,

274
00:11:40,805 --> 00:11:43,265
some magicians collect stamps,

275
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:47,921
and then the conclusion would be what?

276
00:11:47,921 --> 00:12:00,215
Some programmers collect stamps.

277
00:12:00,215 --> 00:12:03,530
Now, I don't know

278
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:06,245
if there are programmers who collect stamps,

279
00:12:06,245 --> 00:12:08,930
but these two premises would not prove it.

280
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:09,460
>> Correct.

281
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:12,560
>> Even if it's true that

282
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,510
some magicians collect stamps and

283
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:17,660
some programmers are magicians,

284
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,460
the problem is that this premise

285
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,530
doesn't tell us that the programmers who are

286
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:25,760
magicians are among the magicians who collect stamps.

287
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,560
Because some magicians collect stamps,

288
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,520
it doesn't tell us they all do.

289
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,490
So I don't know if the programmers who are

290
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:34,580
magicians belong to the group of

291
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,125
magicians who are programmers

292
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,305
or who are outside that group.

293
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:43,815
So this reasoning does not connect.

294
00:12:43,815 --> 00:12:47,390
>> Yes. And you'll see a valid form of reasoning.

295
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,350
A reasoning where that does work in just a moment,

296
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,750
in some of the other examples.

297
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,640
But clearly in these examples,

298
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,590
you cannot get to that final statement as

299
00:12:54,590 --> 00:12:56,880
a necessary conclusion based on the premises.

300
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,590
>> And so in Logic.

301
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,940
>> And you'll learn the principles

302
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,155
of this as we move through the lesson.

303
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,050
>> Yeah, it's a principle distinct.

304
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:04,325
Within logic we call this a fallacy,

305
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,040
meaning a mistaken reasoning.

306
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,340
>> Correct.

307
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,995
>> And again, this I think if you study logic,

308
00:13:09,995 --> 00:13:11,450
you spot mistakes and

309
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,525
reasoning more easily, more readily.

310
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:14,975
Because you're more tuned to

311
00:13:14,975 --> 00:13:18,510
the structure of an argument rather than its content.

312
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:21,010
>> Which is the point of studying logic.

313
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:23,000
>> Yeah, I think if you look just at the content,

314
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,145
it can mislead you.

315
00:13:24,145 --> 00:13:25,840
Because looking just at the content,

316
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,670
you can say all that sounds fine.

317
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,980
But when you think about the abstract structure,

318
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,810
you say wait a minute, there's a problem here.

319
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,680
>> Yes, correct.

320
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:34,120
>> This doesn't prove this.

321
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:41,080
>> Right. Exactly. Here's another example.

322
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,775
>> So, all vegetarians are artists,

323
00:13:44,775 --> 00:13:47,030
all programmers are vegetarians,

324
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:49,170
so all programmers are artists.

325
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:52,650
>> Valid or invalid?

326
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:55,895
>> So, is it valid or invalid?

327
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:59,300
>> So the question is, can you conclude this is

328
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,520
an absolute necessity if

329
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,890
you believe that these two statements are true?

330
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,510
>> So if you think about it,

331
00:14:05,510 --> 00:14:07,850
this is a valid argument.

332
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,970
You have to think it through.

333
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,450
But if you'll learn

334
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,655
the Venn diagram technique that

335
00:14:16,655 --> 00:14:19,505
can let you visually see that this is valid.

336
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:23,610
If all programmers are vegetarians, everyone of them,

337
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:27,275
and every vegetarian is an artist,

338
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:30,020
then it necessarily follows with

339
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:34,210
complete certainty that every programmer is an artist.

340
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,440
This is an example of a valid argument.

341
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,100
>> That's correct.

342
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,540
>> Now, it's interesting

343
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,715
the premises are probably not true.

344
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:43,970
And it's still valid.

345
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:46,180
So this bothers students.

346
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,763
>> Let's talk through that for just a moment.

347
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:49,875
What is going on here?

348
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,375
If you have false premises

349
00:14:52,375 --> 00:14:55,750
and you have a valid argument, how do the two relate?

350
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:59,585
>> Well, this issue,

351
00:14:59,585 --> 00:15:01,870
how can an argument be valid and have

352
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:06,046
false premises bothers all logic students.

353
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:09,300
And it takes a while to get over it.

354
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:14,320
It's a hump. Valid, I have to stress this in logic class.

355
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,910
Valid does not mean true.

356
00:15:17,910 --> 00:15:19,720
In everyday life we

357
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,035
often use the word valid to mean true.

358
00:15:22,035 --> 00:15:23,255
When you say something,

359
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,850
I say you're making a valid point,

360
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:26,960
and I just mean your statement's true.

361
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,090
In logic, valid doesn't mean true.

362
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,565
What valid means is,

363
00:15:31,565 --> 00:15:36,610
if the premises are true, there's the premises.

364
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:38,860
If the premises are true,

365
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,925
the conclusion must be true.

366
00:15:41,925 --> 00:15:48,075
If it were true that all programmers are vegetarians,

367
00:15:48,075 --> 00:15:51,980
and if it were true that all vegetarians are artists,

368
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,410
given those two hypothetical facts,

369
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,775
this would be true.

370
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,070
That's what valid means.

371
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:58,370
>> Yep.

372
00:15:58,370 --> 00:15:59,990
>> But the premises don't have to be

373
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,365
true for an argument to be valid.

374
00:16:03,365 --> 00:16:04,993
This is in fact,

375
00:16:04,993 --> 00:16:08,590
one of the beauties of deductive reasoning,

376
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,710
is that we can reason from one premise to another,

377
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:14,855
from one idea to another without

378
00:16:14,855 --> 00:16:18,275
worrying about whether our starting point is true or not,

379
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:19,790
and then logic can tell us

380
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,540
whether our reasoning is correct.

381
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:21,790
>>Yes.

382
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:26,908
>> Whether our premises are true is a separate task.

383
00:16:26,908 --> 00:16:29,800
>> And we'll separate those in the course.

384
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:33,500
We'll talk through the structure part of making

385
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,360
an argument and the content part of

386
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,710
making an argument as two separate things.

387
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:40,030
What we cal truth, value, and validity.

388
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:40,410
>> Right.

389
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,260
>> And we've been using terms premises

390
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,970
and conclusions. You'll learn about those.

391
00:16:43,970 --> 00:16:45,855
Premises are just the reasons that you

392
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:48,239
offer for something else to be true.

393
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:49,505
If you believe the reasons,

394
00:16:49,505 --> 00:16:52,520
you should conclude that the final statement is true.

395
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,534
>> And I might add a philosophical point, Paul.

396
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:56,920
>> Sure, sure, sure.

397
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,150
>> The ultimate goal of

398
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,640
reasoning is to get at the truth of the matter.

399
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,315
>> Yeah, that's right.

400
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:03,695
>> At the truth of some matter.

401
00:17:03,695 --> 00:17:06,720
That's ultimately why we reason.

402
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,970
And so, if an argument is valid,

403
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:18,345
and in addition, it has all true premises.

404
00:17:18,345 --> 00:17:20,888
Well, I should say if a deductive argument

405
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:21,620
>> Yes.

406
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:25,000
>> Is valid and it has all true premises,

407
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,645
we call that Argument Sound.

408
00:17:27,645 --> 00:17:31,695
So, Soundness, for Deductive Arguments,

409
00:17:31,695 --> 00:17:33,330
is what we're ultimately after.

410
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:34,086
>> That's correct.

411
00:17:34,086 --> 00:17:35,370
>> We're after arguments that

412
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,700
have true premises and their reasoning,

413
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,760
their internal reasoning is valid.

414
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,310
And so, Sound brings in truth.

415
00:17:42,310 --> 00:17:44,070
>> Right. So, what you're going to learn in the course is

416
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,645
to separate those at the beginning,

417
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:47,550
so that you can construct better arguments.

418
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:49,110
And then, you bring them back at

419
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,130
the end to produce

420
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:51,840
sound arguments which is really your goal.

421
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,120
>> And this can help you in everyday life.

422
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,620
>> For sure.

423
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,820
>> Because sometimes we reason with

424
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:59,355
each other and someone's reasoning with us,

425
00:17:59,355 --> 00:18:02,530
and we know they're starting with some false premises.

426
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,545
But, we also know their reasoning isn't correct.

427
00:18:05,545 --> 00:18:08,068
And so, what we can do is we can do, like you said,

428
00:18:08,068 --> 00:18:10,415
we can divide our job into two parts.

429
00:18:10,415 --> 00:18:13,080
Part one is we talk about their reasoning.

430
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,680
>> Yes, correct.

431
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,720
>> And we try to

432
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,600
show them that their reasoning goes wrong.

433
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,890
Part two is when we ask, "Okay.

434
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,011
But now, your premises?

435
00:18:22,011 --> 00:18:24,395
There's a problem here.

436
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,110
One of your premises isn't true."

437
00:18:26,110 --> 00:18:27,780
And so, we can look at the truth of

438
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:30,371
the premises in one operation,

439
00:18:30,371 --> 00:18:33,240
we can look at the validity of the reasoning in another.

440
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,010
And then, when those two go together,

441
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:37,090
you have a complete analysis.

442
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:39,810
>> Great. Alright, let's look at another argument.

443
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,130
>> Okay.

444
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,720
So, this is another deductive argument.

445
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,389
What makes it an argument is the word "Therefore'".

446
00:18:47,389 --> 00:18:50,090
What makes it deductive is the word "Necessarily".

447
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:52,180
So, this is an argument because we

448
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,630
have premises offered for a conclusion.

449
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,160
This is deductive because

450
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,170
the word "Necessarily" indicates

451
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:02,740
that the claim is that if the premises are true,

452
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,300
the conclusion must be true.

453
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,220
>> That's right.

454
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,335
>> So it's a deductive argument

455
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:12,010
and this argument is not valid.

456
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:16,290
But most students before they've studied Logic,

457
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:18,985
look at it and it looks correct.

458
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:22,300
They look at it and it seems correct.

459
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,930
But if you analyze it and think about it,

460
00:19:24,930 --> 00:19:26,340
it's actually not good reasoning.

461
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,630
It's not valid reasoning.

462
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,710
So, do you want to explain why or should I?

463
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:34,375
>> Well, since you're our guest,

464
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:35,360
I think you should explain because they're

465
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,090
going to hear plenty from me in

466
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,963
the course and the rest of the courses.

467
00:19:39,963 --> 00:19:42,325
>> Okay. I have to do the work. So suppose if

468
00:19:42,325 --> 00:19:45,190
Malia goes swimming then Jose goes swimming.

469
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,110
And I'll interpret that to mean,

470
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:50,790
every time Malia swims, Jose swims.

471
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:54,335
Does that premise alone now,

472
00:19:54,335 --> 00:19:58,510
just that premise alone tell

473
00:19:58,510 --> 00:20:05,245
us that every time Jose swims, Malia swims?

474
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:05,362
>> No.

475
00:20:05,362 --> 00:20:07,213
>> It does not. Does it?

476
00:20:07,213 --> 00:20:07,617
>> It does not.

477
00:20:07,617 --> 00:20:09,985
>> It tells us every time she swims, he swims.

478
00:20:09,985 --> 00:20:10,850
>> Correct.

479
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,180
>> But does that premise leave open

480
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,700
the possibility that he swims alone sometimes?

481
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,120
>> Yes.

482
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:22,040
>> So it does. So, just because when she swims,

483
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,710
he swims, it does not logically

484
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,950
follow that when she does not swim,

485
00:20:26,950 --> 00:20:28,360
he does not swim.

486
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,445
He might swim every day

487
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:32,650
and she might swim every other day.

488
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:34,960
In which case, if she swims,

489
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,805
he's swimming with her.

490
00:20:36,805 --> 00:20:40,400
If she swims every day at 9:00 am and he does,

491
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,040
but on the days when she doesn't swim,

492
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,950
he might swim anyway.

493
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,237
>> Yes.

494
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:46,000
>> Now, the second premise simply

495
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,315
adds that Malia will not swim today.

496
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:50,795
So, given just the two premises,

497
00:20:50,795 --> 00:20:54,063
the conclusion isn't proven.

498
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:54,437
>> Right.

499
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:57,390
>> We are not guaranteed that Jose will not swim.

500
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:58,865
Maybe he will anyway -.

501
00:20:58,865 --> 00:20:59,216
>> Yes.

502
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,535
>> Without her. So, this looks valid.

503
00:21:01,535 --> 00:21:03,820
It looks correct, on the surface.

504
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:05,830
It's an example of a fallacy that can

505
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:08,750
mislead people if they haven't studied logic.

506
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:12,190
>> Right. Now, I want the students to take a look at this.

507
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,305
You might pause the video and study this.

508
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,870
And how would you change the premises and

509
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,870
the conclusion so that it does seem as if,

510
00:21:19,870 --> 00:21:21,840
the conclusion wouldn't necessarily follow the premises?

511
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,640
>> That's a good exercise.

512
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,675
>> So, you may not have the skills just yet,

513
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:26,680
if you haven't gone through the course

514
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,105
material yet, to do that.

515
00:21:28,105 --> 00:21:30,455
But this is something that you may want to revisit later.

516
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:31,685
Try this as an exercise.

517
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:33,790
Look at this invalid form and see if you

518
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:34,990
can change it into

519
00:21:34,990 --> 00:21:37,140
a valid form and you'll see a valid form just a moment.

520
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:39,010
>> And the change is very small.

521
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,056
>> Correct. It's a very minor change,

522
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:41,950
but see if you can do it.

523
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,620
And then, once you can get to that point,

524
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,330
you'll start to see the difference between

525
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:49,060
valid and invalid in terms of the structure.

526
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,010
Let's go to the next argument.

527
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:51,165
>> Okay.

528
00:21:51,165 --> 00:21:52,350
>> Now, this looks very similar.

529
00:21:52,350 --> 00:21:54,535
It looks like almost the same argument.

530
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:54,733
>> Yeah.

531
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:55,600
>> But some things changed.

532
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,295
>> Flip back to.

533
00:21:56,295 --> 00:21:56,530
>> Yeah.

534
00:21:56,530 --> 00:21:58,015
>> So, look at the difference.

535
00:21:58,015 --> 00:22:01,480
They do look very similar.

536
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,520
So, this is an argument

537
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,036
that many students when they first look at it,

538
00:22:06,036 --> 00:22:08,810
think it looks invalid,

539
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,810
but it actually turns out to be valid.

540
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:12,980
>> And there's complicated reasons

541
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,410
for why in terms of logic,

542
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:16,760
which we'll talk about later, but let's

543
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,740
talk through the surface reasoning here.

544
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,810
>> Alright. Well, I mean, most people,

545
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:22,980
they look at it and they say, "That looks fine."

546
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,315
I mean, they say that something's

547
00:22:24,315 --> 00:22:25,730
fishy with this argument.

548
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,985
It doesn't look right. They think it's invalid.

549
00:22:27,985 --> 00:22:30,650
But when you think about it,

550
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,585
the first premise says,

551
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:35,854
If Malia goes swimming then Jose goes swimming.

552
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,540
So, every time she swims, he swims.

553
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,015
No exceptions.

554
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:43,055
That's what it says.

555
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:46,780
He's not going to swim today.

556
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:48,540
The second premise adds,

557
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,810
"Jose's not going to swim today".

558
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:54,615
Well then, if that's all the information we know,

559
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:56,940
that's all we need to know,

560
00:22:56,940 --> 00:23:00,035
to know that Malia will not swim today.

561
00:23:00,035 --> 00:23:06,535
Because if she did swim today,

562
00:23:06,535 --> 00:23:09,330
well, let me back up.

563
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:09,887
>> Sure.

564
00:23:09,887 --> 00:23:13,220
>> If she swims, he swims automatically.

565
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,785
Knowing that he's not going to swim today,

566
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:17,990
she's not going to swim today,

567
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:20,015
because if she did swim today,

568
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:21,605
he would swim today,

569
00:23:21,605 --> 00:23:23,115
and he's not swimming,

570
00:23:23,115 --> 00:23:24,635
so she's not swimming.

571
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:26,440
That's how I'd like to think of it.

572
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:26,630
>> Sure. Yeah.

573
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:30,020
>> Yeah. Knowing the premises alone,

574
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,690
we can be assured the conclusion is true.

575
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:37,490
Because if she did swim, he would.

576
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,170
He's not, then she's not.

577
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,260
So, it's valid although it's misleading.

578
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,680
>> It does. It can be very confusing

579
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,940
when you look at this and you can say, "Well,

580
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:49,640
that seems like it's going the wrong way.

581
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,620
It's doing the wrong thing." But when you look at it,

582
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:52,800
it's actually a valid argument.

583
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,261
>> Yeah.

584
00:23:53,261 --> 00:23:54,860
>> It's not Sound as Paul tried

585
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,514
to explain earlier or we don't know if it's Sound.

586
00:23:56,514 --> 00:23:57,540
>> We don't know if it's Sound,

587
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,821
might be, But it's clearly valid.

588
00:23:59,821 --> 00:24:00,290
>> But we can clearly say that it's valid.

589
00:24:00,290 --> 00:24:05,135
>> In virtue of an abstract structure and in logic,

590
00:24:05,135 --> 00:24:07,820
you'll learn that we represent that structure,

591
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:17,070
if P then Q, not Q,

592
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:24,345
so not P. So, in logic,

593
00:24:24,345 --> 00:24:27,100
we take an argument that has

594
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,080
a content and we translate it into

595
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,795
an abstract structure using symbols.

596
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:34,675
And then, we study the symbols

597
00:24:34,675 --> 00:24:37,120
and there are ways of actually

598
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,680
showing in almost a mathematical way

599
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,360
that any argument that follows

600
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,160
this pattern will be valid.

601
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,680
>> That's right. So, what that means is you can plug

602
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,955
any value into P and Q and it would still be valid.

603
00:24:49,955 --> 00:24:51,180
You can even put nonsense.

604
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,220
You could say if foo then bar.

605
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:55,765
Not foo, therefore, not bar.

606
00:24:55,765 --> 00:24:58,010
Sorry, not bar, therefore, not foo.

607
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,700
Yeah, that would still

608
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,510
be valid even though the terms are nonsense.

609
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,090
They don't refer to anything, they don't mean anything.

610
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:07,140
It's still a valid form and if that bothers you,

611
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,510
work your way through the lessons and you'll hopefully

612
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:12,095
see the value of doing that, right?

613
00:25:12,095 --> 00:25:14,070
It doesn't matter what terms you put in for validity

614
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,170
but when you get to Soundness then obviously,

615
00:25:16,170 --> 00:25:17,690
you have to be working with real content.

616
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:21,835
>> Yes. And what shows us the problem is

617
00:25:21,835 --> 00:25:24,030
when we look at it at the level of

618
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,310
form rather than context.

619
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:26,430
>> Yes.

620
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:27,560
>> Then we see the problem.

621
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,130
>> That's right. Here's another one.

622
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,335
>> In this one,

623
00:25:32,335 --> 00:25:36,220
I chose as an example of an argument that

624
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:40,400
many people don't think is valid and yet it is again,

625
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,640
that it's often students think is not

626
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,110
valid and yet it is clearly valid.

627
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:45,469
>> This is a valid argument.

628
00:25:45,469 --> 00:25:49,065
>> So, we have to think it through.

629
00:25:49,065 --> 00:25:52,675
A common response to this argument is, okay.

630
00:25:52,675 --> 00:25:55,315
If it's raining the roof is wet.

631
00:25:55,315 --> 00:25:58,335
It's raining and they will say,

632
00:25:58,335 --> 00:26:02,730
"But the roof might not be wet and so it's not valid."

633
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:04,110
In other words, they say,

634
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:07,740
the premises don't prove the conclusion with certainty.

635
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,405
And then, I often will say, "Why?

636
00:26:10,405 --> 00:26:11,465
What's the problem here?"

637
00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:13,090
And they'll say, "Well,

638
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:15,220
if it's raining the roof is wet."

639
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,125
I'll grant that and it's raining.

640
00:26:18,125 --> 00:26:20,925
Yes, I'll grant that but then they say,

641
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:23,180
here's the house, they say,

642
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:26,265
"What if there's a big tarp over the roof?

643
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:29,225
To prevent the roof from getting wet."

644
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:31,420
They say, "What if that's the case,

645
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:33,200
then the roof won't be wet?"

646
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,900
And so then, they conclude from

647
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:39,355
this idea that that's an invalid argument.

648
00:26:39,355 --> 00:26:41,785
And so, this is again,

649
00:26:41,785 --> 00:26:44,470
it's an example that I'm using to

650
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:47,540
show where logic can improve our reasoning.

651
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,850
If you think about it,

652
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:50,590
if someone had a tarp over

653
00:26:50,590 --> 00:26:53,260
the roof that kept the roof dry,

654
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,120
then what would that mean?

655
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,580
>> This premise is not true.

656
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:59,460
>> It would mean that the first premise is not true.

657
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,960
Now, to call this valid is simply to say that

658
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:05,480
if the premises are true,

659
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,140
if they're true, then the conclusion must be true.

660
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:13,520
So, it's all based on "If", "Then".

661
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,495
If the premises are true,

662
00:27:15,495 --> 00:27:16,930
there is no tarp over the roof.

663
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:17,520
>> That's correct because

664
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,155
the first premise is telling us,

665
00:27:19,155 --> 00:27:21,950
if it's raining, it must be the case that the roof is wet.

666
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,723
It's not possible for not to be wet.

667
00:27:23,723 --> 00:27:23,981
>> Yeah.

668
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:25,695
>> Right? That's what that first premise is telling us.

669
00:27:25,695 --> 00:27:28,845
So that's why when we assert that it's actually raining,

670
00:27:28,845 --> 00:27:31,020
we know the roof has to be wet with

671
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,185
certainty because that's what our first premise tells us.

672
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:35,520
Now, if there's a tarp, then we would

673
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,690
never make that first claim.

674
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,391
We would never claim if it's raining the roof is wet,

675
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:40,899
because there might be a tarp right?.

676
00:27:40,899 --> 00:27:43,888
But we're looking mainly at the structure, right?

677
00:27:43,888 --> 00:27:45,370
The structure is the

678
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:51,255
>> Yeah. The structure makes it valid, not the content.

679
00:27:51,255 --> 00:27:52,660
The rain, the roof.

680
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,276
>> That's right.

681
00:27:54,276 --> 00:27:57,400
For the same reason that we saw in the last argument.

682
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,100
Alright. Now, I want to spend just a couple,

683
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,838
I think we have two more slides left.

684
00:28:00,838 --> 00:28:01,980
I want to spend a little bit of

685
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,290
time on Inductive Arguments.

686
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,780
And the reason for this is a lot of students I've found

687
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,920
in the last two quarters that I've

688
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,480
taught in this online course,

689
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,950
a lot of students seem to struggle

690
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:13,540
with this format of argument.

691
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,940
So, it's a really good format

692
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,260
because it does help you actually

693
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,090
practice the process of

694
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,410
induction and thinking about

695
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,130
strength and all the rest of it.

696
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,590
But I've noticed that

697
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:25,020
students really struggle with thinking through this.

698
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,610
So first of all, quickly explain the difference

699
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,260
between Inductive and Deductive Arguments.

700
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,630
What are we talking about here?

701
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:36,032
>> Okay. So again, logicians distinguish

702
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:38,855
between Deductive Arguments,

703
00:28:38,855 --> 00:28:40,730
which attempt to show their

704
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:43,605
conclusion must be true with certainty.

705
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:47,625
And Inductive Arguments, which aim a little lower,

706
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,850
they only try to show that the conclusion

707
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,187
is probable but not certain.

708
00:28:53,187 --> 00:28:58,480
Probability is a concept from everyday life.

709
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,805
When Paul and I leave the studio,

710
00:29:01,805 --> 00:29:03,520
I'll head to my car,

711
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:08,500
and my car is probably going to be where I parked it.

712
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,785
But, of course, I'm not certain it will be there.

713
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:14,300
It's all probability.

714
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:16,170
I think it's a very high probability.

715
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:17,027
>> Yeah, sure.

716
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:18,415
>> So, most things in life

717
00:29:18,415 --> 00:29:22,275
revolve around probability estimates.

718
00:29:22,275 --> 00:29:27,860
But an inductive argument attempts

719
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,990
to show that its conclusion is probable

720
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:32,565
>> And that probability is a range, right?

721
00:29:32,565 --> 00:29:34,420
It can be a low probability or high probability.

722
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:38,630
>> Yeah. For the sake of our discussion,

723
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:42,215
we can say point five and above,

724
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:43,727
but less than one.

725
00:29:43,727 --> 00:29:46,370
So, more than 50 percent

726
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:49,974
probable but less than 100 percent certain,

727
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:51,815
we'll call that probability.

728
00:29:51,815 --> 00:29:55,175
So, now we have an argument,

729
00:29:55,175 --> 00:29:57,080
it's an inductive argument because of

730
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,150
the presence of the word "probably."

731
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:04,210
We interviewed 10 randomly selected adults

732
00:30:04,210 --> 00:30:06,070
from the kingdom of Ruritania,

733
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:12,090
an imaginary land, and we found that all 10 play soccer.

734
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,670
We conclude that probably

735
00:30:14,670 --> 00:30:18,295
all adult Ruritanians play soccer.

736
00:30:18,295 --> 00:30:28,050
Probably. And so, that argument has,

737
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:31,005
well, it depends on how big the kingdom is.

738
00:30:31,005 --> 00:30:35,685
Let's say the kingdom of Ruritania only has 200 people.

739
00:30:35,685 --> 00:30:37,265
It's a very small kingdom.

740
00:30:37,265 --> 00:30:43,610
I would call that a pretty strong argument because

741
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:47,550
>> Is the sample size.

742
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:49,300
>> The premise is true, I think that

743
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,165
makes it somewhat probable,

744
00:30:52,165 --> 00:30:54,730
that above 50 percent,

745
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:57,430
that all adults play soccer.

746
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,850
That's a fairly strong argument.

747
00:30:59,850 --> 00:31:01,565
> So hopefully, again,

748
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:02,800
pause the video, look at

749
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,610
the argument if you're not seeing it.

750
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:06,820
And see if you can see why that probability is.

751
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,530
>> They're randomly selected.

752
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,050
>> Yes, randomly selected.

753
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,170
>> They all play Soccer.

754
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,480
>> And it's not specifically calling out men or women,

755
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,135
it's just sampling of all the adults, Right?.

756
00:31:16,135 --> 00:31:22,580
>> So now, we can think about our response.

757
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,085
We'll make some elementary changes.

758
00:31:25,085 --> 00:31:27,625
So, let's change the conclusion to,

759
00:31:27,625 --> 00:31:31,720
"most adults, Ruritanians play soccer."

760
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,128
So, previously we said they all do,

761
00:31:34,128 --> 00:31:36,200
probably they all do.

762
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,530
Now, let's say, probably most do.

763
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:41,950
>> Now, in my course when students see this,

764
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,650
they believe that the strength of the argument goes

765
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:46,360
down because we're using

766
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:48,580
the term "most," which is weaker.

767
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,050
"All" is a strong statement,

768
00:31:50,050 --> 00:31:51,570
"most" is a weak statement,

769
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:53,691
so the conclusion that students tend to draw is,

770
00:31:53,691 --> 00:31:55,420
Okay, that's a weaker argument,

771
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,370
the strength of the overall probability is

772
00:31:57,370 --> 00:31:59,650
weaker because we're using a weaker term.

773
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,600
Instead of having that all inclusive term,

774
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,850
we have a less inclusive term.

775
00:32:02,850 --> 00:32:04,261
>> Very good.

776
00:32:04,261 --> 00:32:08,050
In fact the logical truth is exactly the reverse.

777
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:09,320
>> That's correct, the strength goes up.

778
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,765
>> So, it's a logical and optical illusion,

779
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,250
but when we say,

780
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,665
most probably play soccer,

781
00:32:17,665 --> 00:32:21,700
that conclusion has a higher probability

782
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:23,275
than the one that says,

783
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:26,030
all probably play soccer.

784
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:28,000
And the reason for that is that,

785
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:32,895
when we draw an inductive conclusion, we're making claim.

786
00:32:32,895 --> 00:32:36,825
And the more narrowly we draw the claim,

787
00:32:36,825 --> 00:32:39,165
the more precise our claim,

788
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:42,660
the more chances there are that the claim is false.

789
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:45,435
And the more broadly we draw the claim,

790
00:32:45,435 --> 00:32:49,035
the more chances we have that the claim comes true.

791
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:52,275
So, to go back here,

792
00:32:52,275 --> 00:32:57,300
if even one adult Ruritanian doesn't play soccer,

793
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:58,920
just one, then our

794
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:03,670
conclusion that all adult Ruritanians

795
00:33:03,670 --> 00:33:05,632
play soccer, is false.

796
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:06,300
>> That's right.

797
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,920
>> But now in this case,

798
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,400
if one adult Ruritanian doesn't play soccer,

799
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,255
it's still true that most of them do, so,

800
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:19,315
we have more chance that this is true,

801
00:33:19,315 --> 00:33:22,010
based on the evidence then that this is true.

802
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,710
>> So, which is then there is more chance that

803
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,290
the second conclusion is true than this one,

804
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:29,020
and that more chance means that the argument is stronger.

805
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:29,129
>> Stronger.

806
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:31,018
>> It's a stronger inductive argument.

807
00:33:31,018 --> 00:33:34,280
Even though it might seem intuitively opposite, right?

808
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,490
You see a weaker phrase,

809
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:38,470
a weaker term, and you automatically

810
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:39,435
think that the argument is

811
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,040
weaker but that's not how it works.

812
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,340
The weaker term actually makes the argument stronger.

813
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,800
And that's also true to at

814
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,770
least changing to at least half. Now, you're reducing.

815
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:49,890
>> I'm making a weaker claim,

816
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:51,955
and a more general claim.

817
00:33:51,955 --> 00:33:55,600
And this is even more highly probable

818
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,600
that 51 percent play soccer.

819
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,190
That's even more probable on the evidence.

820
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:03,620
>> Yes.

821
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,330
>> Than the first prep. The worst conclusion.

822
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,920
>> Right. So, it's very important that

823
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,630
as you're working through these arguments,

824
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,040
that you think very carefully

825
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,050
about what the arguments are claiming,

826
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:18,401
and think of strength as the probability,

827
00:34:18,401 --> 00:34:19,960
the degree of strength as the probability

828
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,185
that the conclusion is true.

829
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:21,940
>> Based on the premise.

830
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,440
>> Based on the truth of the premise.

831
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:24,610
>> Now,

832
00:34:24,610 --> 00:34:25,240
>> What are you doing here?

833
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,700
>> Also now, we have the reverse orientation.

834
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:34,465
So, now we're going to add a premise to the argument.

835
00:34:34,465 --> 00:34:38,685
The 10 adults, they wore beards,

836
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:41,610
no other Ruritanians wore beards.

837
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,630
So the 10 adults that we interviewed,

838
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:48,180
we're going to add that they all wore beards,

839
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,840
whereas no one else wore beards.

840
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:55,210
Does that make the argument stronger or weaker?

841
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:59,510
>> I don't think it has any impact on the argument.

842
00:34:59,510 --> 00:35:02,495
The wearing of beards does not seem to have any impact.

843
00:35:02,495 --> 00:35:05,030
>> Well, this is where people will

844
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:08,075
disagree because it is somewhat subjective here.

845
00:35:08,075 --> 00:35:14,120
It seems to me that weakens the argument for this reason.

846
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,445
We've got us a sample of 10 randomly selected adults,

847
00:35:19,445 --> 00:35:21,185
and we're making an inference about

848
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:23,940
all the adults in Ruritania.

849
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,020
So, this premise tells us that

850
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:30,360
those adults in our sample are

851
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,730
a little different from the rest of the population.

852
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:34,245
>> So it's only half the population

853
00:35:34,245 --> 00:35:35,930
because they're all men, is that what you are telling?

854
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:39,025
>> Well, no. All we're assuming,

855
00:35:39,025 --> 00:35:41,231
oh, because women don't have beards.

856
00:35:41,231 --> 00:35:43,440
I didn't think of that. I didn't

857
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,230
>> So, walk through your reasoning.

858
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:48,505
>> Okay. So, my reasoning is that,

859
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:50,580
when we add this premise,

860
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,465
we're now adding the additional information that

861
00:35:54,465 --> 00:35:59,064
our sample is different.

862
00:35:59,064 --> 00:36:00,540
>> Because of this. This is very.

863
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,710
>> None of the other Ruritanians wore beards.

864
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:03,130
>> Got it. I see.

865
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,320
>> So, our sample is a little

866
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,220
bit oddball from the rest of the population,

867
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:12,695
which weakens our confidence that what

868
00:36:12,695 --> 00:36:14,290
we learned about the sample is true

869
00:36:14,290 --> 00:36:16,240
of the rest of the population.

870
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:16,523
>> Sure.

871
00:36:16,523 --> 00:36:18,430
>> It just weakens the argument.

872
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,870
>> Yes. Now, if we didn't include this,

873
00:36:19,870 --> 00:36:22,166
it may not have any impact because we've included

874
00:36:22,166 --> 00:36:23,080
>> Yeah, yeah. That's right.

875
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,454
>> Because we've included that

876
00:36:24,454 --> 00:36:27,420
>> Because they're the only ones wearing beards,

877
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:30,295
it suggests that there's something unique about them.

878
00:36:30,295 --> 00:36:33,490
Which means that, our inference from them to the rest of

879
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,590
the population is a little more

880
00:36:35,590 --> 00:36:38,200
suspect than it was before we knew this.

881
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:38,562
>> Got it.

882
00:36:38,562 --> 00:36:40,510
>> Okay. So, that shows you

883
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:43,300
want your sample to be random,

884
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:46,278
and you want it to be diverse,

885
00:36:46,278 --> 00:36:48,090
you want it to be representative.

886
00:36:48,090 --> 00:36:50,200
If there is some reason to think the sample is

887
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,515
special or not random,

888
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:57,120
that casts doubt on your conclusion and makes it weaker.

889
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,240
>> Now, this is a great example and

890
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,040
our conversation is a good example of

891
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,020
how determining the strength

892
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,510
of inductive arguments can be tricky,

893
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,920
and we acknowledge this in the course.

894
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,900
The examples that we try to provide in

895
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,760
the course which largely come out of your textbook,

896
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,155
are a little bit simpler.

897
00:37:13,155 --> 00:37:14,360
So, we're not going to do tricky things

898
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,585
like only men wear beards,

899
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:17,677
therefore we're only interviewing men.

900
00:37:17,677 --> 00:37:19,905
We don't want you make those inductive leaps,

901
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,380
but you can see that trying to

902
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:22,820
find the strength can be tricky.

903
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,520
So, our recommendation is that you slow down,

904
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,920
you make sure that you go through that material multiple

905
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,740
times if you're not getting it, and just practice.

906
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:32,235
Walk through the exercises,

907
00:37:32,235 --> 00:37:34,400
we have a number of samples in the coursework

908
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,140
that are exactly like this format.

909
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:39,620
We add information and then you get to practice to see

910
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:43,950
whether the conclusion is more or less probable.

911
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:46,130
But take your time and work through those examples.

912
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,600
If you rush through this stuff,

913
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,305
particularly as you're getting used to it and you're

914
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:51,470
learning, you're going to make mistakes.

915
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,700
So, the way that you avoid

916
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,930
those mistakes is to slow down.

917
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:55,965
>> Well, I would add, if I may.

918
00:37:55,965 --> 00:37:57,710
>> Sure.

919
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:02,230
>> It's tricky and it's also a little bit subjective.

920
00:38:02,230 --> 00:38:04,670
We don't have a precise measure

921
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,910
of probability in a case like this.

922
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,945
>> Correct.

923
00:38:07,945 --> 00:38:09,810
>> We would need to know more.

924
00:38:09,810 --> 00:38:13,135
Under certain very special conditions

925
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:15,685
that require a lot more information

926
00:38:15,685 --> 00:38:18,220
and many more assumptions,

927
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,235
in inductive logic we can actually calculate

928
00:38:21,235 --> 00:38:24,600
mathematically the exact probability of that conclusion.

929
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,860
But we can only use mathematics

930
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,500
and calculate probabilities with precision,

931
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:31,780
when there's a lot more information and

932
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,925
there's a lot of really specific information,

933
00:38:33,925 --> 00:38:36,754
and we have to bring in a whole bunch of assumptions.

934
00:38:36,754 --> 00:38:40,555
But, cases like this that are close to ordinary life,

935
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:45,265
the judgment of probability is a little bit subjective,

936
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:49,495
although probably 90 percent of all people would agree

937
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:57,664
that this argument makes it somewhat probable.

938
00:38:57,664 --> 00:38:59,120
Most people would agree

939
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,350
within a range or a certain number of points.

940
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,460
But this shows that the study of logic can help

941
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,260
you see patterns of reasoning differently,

942
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:12,020
see strengths and weaknesses you didn't see before.

943
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,805
>> Totally agree, and I think this is very helpful.

944
00:39:14,805 --> 00:39:16,220
So, we're giving you

945
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:18,380
this material at the beginning of your study,

946
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,165
so that as you go into

947
00:39:20,165 --> 00:39:23,600
the topics on inductive and deductive reasoning,

948
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,305
you'll start to know what to look for.

949
00:39:25,305 --> 00:39:26,510
And so, there are some terms here that

950
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,100
you may not be familiar with,

951
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,630
but you will become familiar

952
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:30,650
with them and you'll learn how to

953
00:39:30,650 --> 00:39:33,590
use them and apply them as you work through the material.

954
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,940
So, Dr. Herrick, thank you so much

955
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,170
for spending some time with us.

956
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:36,550
>> Thank you, Paul.

957
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:37,850
>> Really good to have a conversation

958
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:41,470
and take advantage of your expertise.

959
00:39:41,470 --> 00:39:44,135
Your book has been fantastic addition to the course,

960
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:45,610
and it's really great to have this conversation.

961
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:46,967
>> I appreciate your using it,

962
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,330
and thank you for your compliments too.

963
00:39:49,330 --> 00:39:51,150
>> Thank you, and thanks for watching.

964
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:51,580
>> Thank you.

965
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,940
>> I hope you enjoy the next two modules.
