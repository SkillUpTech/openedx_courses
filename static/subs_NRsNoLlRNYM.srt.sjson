And so,","let's actually start with the underlying data models.","So let's do key value document-oriented column and graph.","And on top of these, we have all these different APIs.","We have these Tables API,","DocumentDB,","MongoDB and Gremlin.","And an easier way to think about this is,","what is the core scenario?","What is the core problem that you want to solve?","Rather than starting with that technology and","going into the scenario","or the problem that you want to solve,","you actually want to start from the problem itself.","And to give you some kind of a context in terms of what","these different data models","are really kind of geared around,","so a key value data model and the Tables API,","what this really is optimized for is key value access.","So if you were to be given, let's say,","a key and this can be a primary key,","what is the value underneath this?","For a document-oriented model,","really what this provides is a flexible schema.","And because Cosmos DB is","uniquely capable of automatically","indexing every property of every document","coming in without knowing the schemea up front,","this actually gives you an ability","to then take something that","was key value and then build a very,","very rich query and index layer on top of this.","And of course, for the Gremlin API,","the Gremlin API allows you to do","graph traversal on top of a graph that,","let's say, you've ingested with any of these other APIs.","Or you can actually ingest it directly into Gremlin.","And so think of the world as a bunch","of vertices and edges,","and what you can do is you can actually write","a traversal starting from, let's say,","this vertice, find outbound edges,","and then out of these vertices, find other relationships.","Let's say, we even annotate.","This as a person.","For person1, find all of","the people that you know and then out of those,","find the edges that represent interests and","find what are the interests of my friends.",">> Oh, wow. Yeah. So I'm going to have fun with this.","Let's hit a lightning round.","So if I wanted to do something like a cache store,","what type of API would I consider?","Even if there's not one right answer.","How would I make that decision?",">> So, the things that you want to think","about is the access patterns themselves.","For when you do caching,","what you really want is low latency.","And here's one of","the other really cool things about","Cosmos DB is because you get","predictable low latency with","less than 10 millisecond real latencies.","What you can actually do is,","rather than maintaining, you can have","caches like a separate memory data store.","You can actually remove some of","the outer caching logic and then embed.","If you don't want to do caching, do it directly in","the application side and","then rely on Cosmos DB for low latency.","But then, going back here,","what do you want to think about with respect to APIs","is what does the access patterns look like?","If you're always doing queries","on a certain set of properties,","perhaps the DocumentDB API is a good fit.","Or if you're doing primarily","a key value or you just access by the primary key,","the Tables API is very well geared for that.","And of course, with Gremlin, you get a lot of","very rich query ability in","terms of doing these kind of traversals.","The other thing that this really opens","up is if you have, let's say,","an existing MongoDB application,","and what you're finding is that over time,","you would really love to take advantage of","the corporate capabilities of Cosmos DB,","as well as just get out of","the loop of having to babysit your servers,","we also provide this fully managed service","and then allow you to actually then do things,","really cool things, like Gremlin queries","on top of the MongoDB data set.",">> So if I had a MEAN stack application,","I could just literally put the MongoDB API in","place with my existing MongoDB database instance are.","From where I'm from, we used to have a joke.","We had some applications that","used the DEAN stack which was","DocumentDB express angular node.","So I could just use these as","a fully managed way as","opposed to like you were talking about,","having to manage model Mongo.","I'm a developer. I don't really want","to manage my own MongoDB server unless I have to,","but I can use this fully managed service in that case.",">> Absolutely. And this way,","you get to take advantage of.","We have 24/7 on-call rotations making","sure that we re-patch your database, it stays up to date.","Those come seamless to you,","as well as if anything happens,","we run a highly redundant architecture underneath.","And what we do is if something were to go wrong, I mean,","we wake up at the middle of the night and","make sure that your database is rock solid and","online so that you get to have peace of","mind and relax while we take care of it for you.",">> This sounds wonderful.","One of the great things about","this is just so many different APIs,","so many different ways to tackle problems.","You can cover a lot of business scenarios by using","either a combination of APIs","or different APIs for different purposes.","So again, very exciting and","looking forward to try and use the different APIs."]}
