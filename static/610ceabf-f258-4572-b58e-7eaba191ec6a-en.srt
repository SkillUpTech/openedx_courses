00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:02,390
In a previous lesson,

1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:06,510
we saw that logic is the science of studying arguments, and

2
00:00:06,510 --> 00:00:08,520
arguments consist of three things.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,240
Premises, which are reasons that you offer to support

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,850
another thing called the conclusion, and there has to be

5
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,490
a logical relationship between the premises and the conclusion.

6
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:21,170
What we're gonna do now is look at what makes up

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:23,670
these premises and conclusions, what are they?

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,117
And how do we create good ones,

9
00:00:25,117 --> 00:00:27,633
how do we create good premises and good conclusions?

10
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:29,730
We're gonna look at two components of this.

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,390
The first is statements, and the second is propositions.

12
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:34,620
Let's start with statements.

13
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:41,570
So a statement is just a sentence, a linguistic sentence,

14
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,320
that expresses some truth or possible truth.

15
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,671
So when you make a statement,

16
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,677
you're declaring that something is true.

17
00:00:48,677 --> 00:00:52,281
Here's some examples, all US citizens live in the US,

18
00:00:52,281 --> 00:00:54,210
that is a statement of truth.

19
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,163
It could be true, it could be false, we don't know, but

20
00:00:57,163 --> 00:01:00,423
all we're saying at this point is this is a statement declaring

21
00:01:00,423 --> 00:01:02,960
that something is possibly true.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,310
The next two statements,

23
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,500
the next statement is actually false.

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:10,260
Most businesses in Seattle use red carpeting in their offices,

25
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:14,300
of course that could be true, it's most likely false.

26
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,970
But it's still declaring a statement of truth,

27
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,320
a possible truth claim.

28
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,630
Some people may not know whether that's true or false, so

29
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:25,180
you might do a study and sample all businesses in Seattle to

30
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:26,860
see what color carpeting they have and

31
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:28,810
then you could figure out whether it's true or false.

32
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,330
That's not the point right now.

33
00:01:30,330 --> 00:01:32,842
It's just looking at how a statement is constructed,

34
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,270
it's a declaration of truth.

35
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:35,704
And the same is true for the last one,

36
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:38,670
Apple has a higher market capitalization than Microsoft.

37
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,691
That's true at the time of this recording and

38
00:01:41,691 --> 00:01:44,320
it's something that we can evaluate.

39
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,746
Okay, so when we're talking about a statement,

40
00:01:46,746 --> 00:01:50,350
we're talking about that declarative truth claim.

41
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,242
Now not all things that we say are declarative in this

42
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:54,169
sense, right?

43
00:01:54,169 --> 00:01:57,564
These are obviously talking about English, but

44
00:01:57,564 --> 00:02:00,628
most languages have constructs like this,

45
00:02:00,628 --> 00:02:03,680
have verbal constructs like this.

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,270
And we can see that there's different types of things that

47
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:08,130
we can say, right?

48
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:11,190
We can ask a question, what's the time?

49
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,130
We can give commands like shut the door.

50
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,366
We can make an exclamation, if you drop something on your toe

51
00:02:17,366 --> 00:02:20,601
you might yell out ouch or whatever, that's not a statement

52
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:23,405
of truth, you're expressing an emotion, right?

53
00:02:23,405 --> 00:02:28,410
So, only declaratives then qualify as statements in logic.

54
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,090
It has to be either true or false.

55
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,050
You have to be able to apply a truth or

56
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:37,450
a falsity claim to the statement that you're making, okay?

57
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,930
So declaratives then are statements in logic,

58
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,590
why, because those are the things that we say are true or

59
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,890
false, okay?

60
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,007
Now, when we're putting together arguments,

61
00:02:50,007 --> 00:02:53,428
we're gonna use statements to do it and in logic there

62
00:02:53,428 --> 00:02:57,014
are very specific ways to construct these statements.

63
00:02:57,014 --> 00:03:00,147
And I'm gonna talk about two types that you'll be able to use

64
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,650
when you're creating arguments.

65
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,926
The first type is called a simple statement and

66
00:03:05,926 --> 00:03:10,548
it's very simple linguistically, simple grammatically, and

67
00:03:10,548 --> 00:03:13,640
it makes a single claim to truth, right?

68
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:15,650
Look at the examples I have here.

69
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,226
Ann is home.

70
00:03:16,226 --> 00:03:19,090
Very simple grammatically, right, there's a subject,

71
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,200
a verb and an object, and

72
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,640
it is making a declarative statement of truth.

73
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,328
Either Ann is home or she's not, but

74
00:03:25,328 --> 00:03:27,191
it is claiming that Ann is home, right?

75
00:03:27,191 --> 00:03:30,100
There's no other truths that we're gonna look at here.

76
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:33,230
We're only gonna determine whether Ann is actually home.

77
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:36,230
So that's called a simple statement in logic,

78
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,250
because it's only talking about one possible truth value.

79
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,210
The same for the second one,

80
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:43,669
the screen door has a hole in it, very simple grammatically,

81
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:48,950
also claims to make only one single truth claim, all right?

82
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,201
Now we can take these simple statements,

83
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:53,583
these simple declarative statements, and

84
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:57,390
connect them with other simple declarative statements.

85
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:59,910
It's really important to understand how these

86
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,493
link together, so as you construct arguments,

87
00:04:02,493 --> 00:04:05,518
you can disassemble either arguments you're reading or

88
00:04:05,518 --> 00:04:07,800
construct arguments in a much easier way.

89
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,510
All right, so we can join these simple statements by

90
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,960
what's called a statement operator.

91
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,780
And by the way, if you're a computer programmer,

92
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:18,610
you're hopefully starting to hear some similar language to

93
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:21,650
what you might do in computer programming, all right?

94
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:24,450
So these statement operators are used to connect

95
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,170
simple statements and create compound statements, all right?

96
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,960
And in logic you always want to start with simple statements and

97
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,450
use statement operators to construct larger complex

98
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,220
statements, right?

99
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,780
So here we have two operators AND an OR, and in

100
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:46,760
the first compound statement I say Ann is home AND Bob is home.

101
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:50,110
Now notice we have two statements of truth value.

102
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:52,368
Ann is home is one declarative statement,

103
00:04:52,368 --> 00:04:54,350
it's either true or false.

104
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,030
Bob is home is a second declarative statement that's

105
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,350
either true or false, and

106
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,530
we are joining them by this AND operator.

107
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,840
Notice also that Ann is home could be true,

108
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:06,980
Bob is home could be false.

109
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,480
And that's

110
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,590
gonna change the truth value of the whole compound statement.

111
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,741
The individual simple statements have their own truth value.

112
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:16,761
And when they're put together by an operator AND,

113
00:05:16,761 --> 00:05:20,020
they're gonna have a truth value as a whole.

114
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,470
So then we would say,

115
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,690
we would put the truth value above the AND, and

116
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:27,230
say the statement as a whole is either true or false, all right?

117
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:28,860
The same is true with the second one,

118
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,570
the screen door has a hole in it.

119
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:35,520
A statement of truth OR, this is the operator, I'm seeing things,

120
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,970
another statement of truth.

121
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:40,340
You can have one or both be true, or one or

122
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,066
both be false, okay?

123
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,590
So this is how you construct statements in arguments.

124
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,460
And when you make your argument,

125
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:49,820
you're gonna be putting together premises.

126
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:53,130
Those premises are gonna be composed of either simple or

127
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:54,490
compound statements.

128
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,192
And the conclusion itself is also going to be a simple or

129
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:58,710
compound statement.

130
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,210
And these are the building blocks of logical arguments.

131
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,950
This is how you construct them, and

132
00:06:04,950 --> 00:06:07,677
this is the first step in constructing good arguments.
