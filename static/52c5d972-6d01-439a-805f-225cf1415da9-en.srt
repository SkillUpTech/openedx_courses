Hi and welcome to this module on critical thinking.

1
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:08,110
You've been studying different forms of logical analysis.

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:11,040
We've given you some information on how you construct statements

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,200
and put arguments together.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,660
This module really is about application.

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:18,860
So now that you have all these tools, what do you do with them?

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:21,900
And critical thinking really is the discipline

7
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:24,890
of applying logical analysis to the world.

8
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:28,360
Looking at arguments people are making, arguments that you want

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,660
to develop and then focusing those arguments in a very

10
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,830
specific way so that you can convince people of something.

11
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:39,460
Critical thinking is a little bit broader than logic itself.

12
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,670
Critical thinking involves an attitude as well as a set of

13
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:47,060
analytic tools that you can use and we really

14
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,740
call it a discipline and you want to think of it as a way of

15
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,280
being in the world, a way of thinking about the world.

16
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,710
So to me, critical thinking is the important

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:58,360
practical application of logic.

18
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,820
So in this module, you're going to see less of that kind of

19
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,890
mathematical syllogistic approach to logic, and more of

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:10,280
how you apply it, how you think about actual world problems.

21
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:13,850
So in this module, or in this video, what I'd like to do

22
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,440
is talk through an example of a person that tried to apply this

23
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,470
methodology to the way that he thought about the world,

24
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,620
and we're gonna look at this example as a way of kind of

25
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,730
a radical example.

26
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:26,280
It's an extreme example but

27
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:28,650
it's a way of being a critical thinker and

28
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:31,720
applying these skills that we've been looking at.

29
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,680
Right so what is critical thinking as a discipline?

30
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,130
Well, one way to word this or one way to define it is to say

31
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:41,500
that it's the discipline that allows us to shape and

32
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:44,340
refine and exercise our thoughts.

33
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,860
Exercise the faculties or the capacity,

34
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,800
the capabilities of our mind to think more clearly about

35
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,100
the subjects that we're discussing, right?

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,920
And we can apply this to any subject, right?

37
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,970
We can be a critical thinker about any subject.

38
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,580
When we think of the term critical,

39
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,530
it sounds like it's a negative term,

40
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,160
we tend to think of critical as being critical of somebody and

41
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,290
that tends to have a negative connotation.

42
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:11,400
But really critical thinking is just about being hyper-aware of

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,490
what's going on, of what people are claiming, of what you're

44
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:18,140
trying to claim, and doing that analysis in depth.

45
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:20,060
Just being aware of what you're saying, and

46
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,950
what you're hearing, and being able to tear those ideas apart

47
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,320
in a more refined way, okay?

48
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,060
So, I used the example here,

49
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:32,410
develop the skills to argue without being argumentative.

50
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:35,090
Without just disagreeing with everything because you feel like

51
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,620
disagreeing with everything.

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:39,700
Arguing for a point, because there's a good

53
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,840
goal that you have in mind, a virtuous goal, is different than

54
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,850
just disagreeing with everything for the sake of disagreement.

55
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:49,070
We want to develop that discipline.

56
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,290
How do you argue without being overly argumentative?

57
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,350
How do you examine ideas and adopt all sides of an idea so

58
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,570
you can test it for its truth.

59
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:01,530
I have a really good quote here from Aristotle.

60
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:02,540
It's one of my favorites.

61
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,500
It's a mark of an educated mind,

62
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,730
to be able to entertain a thought without holding it.

63
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,300
How many of us can do that really well.

64
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,100
We can actually adopt the other side.

65
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,930
Think about your political stands.

66
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:17,240
Right, we all tend to have a critical view point.

67
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,650
Can you fully adopt the other side is if you held it

68
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,930
without really accepting it as true?

69
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:25,030
That's the year marks of a critical thinker,

70
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,520
being able to see the other side fully and

71
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,430
then say I actually disagree and here's why.

72
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:31,020
Okay?

73
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:34,540
Not just disagreeing with sound bytes or

74
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:37,150
something that you think the other side is holding.

75
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:40,640
It's actually adopting that other side's position fully.

76
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,130
Understanding why it's rational.

77
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,440
If it is rational and why it's reasonable and

78
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,250
then providing a disagreeing argument against that idea.

79
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,290
That's critical thinking.

80
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,960
That's what it means to embody the nature of

81
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,110
a critical thinker.

82
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,050
So in a lot of ways,

83
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,930
critical thinking we define it as an intellectual virtue.

84
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:00,620
An intellectual virtue.

85
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,900
So what is virtuous habit, a virtuous disposition?

86
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,980
It's those parts of your intellectual life

87
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,940
that just make you better at life in general, right.

88
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,120
It gives you a kind of excellence and again we use

89
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,070
the term here disposition and discipline very intentionally.

90
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:22,480
A disposition is something that starts to become natural

91
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,240
the more you do it.

92
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:25,430
If you have a disposition,

93
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,140
when you walk up to an ice cream stand for example,

94
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:31,170
if you have a disposition to choose vanilla over chocolate,

95
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,280
that's something that's kind of ingrained in you, right?

96
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,570
Like when you go to the ice cream stand,

97
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,005
you kind of have to think a lot of you don't wanna get vanilla.

98
00:04:38,005 --> 00:04:39,880
Disposition is to always get vanilla ice cream or

99
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,390
chocolate or whatever it is.

100
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,040
Right?

101
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,440
It's the, it's your, a habit of mind.

102
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:46,790
It's a way that you respond to the world.

103
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:50,670
Now most of us have some dispositions which we wish we

104
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:53,680
didn't have, they're not virtuous, they're things that we

105
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,150
don't want to do naturally and so it takes a lot of work to

106
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:01,570
develop new dispositions, to develop new habits.

107
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,020
And if you approach arguments, if you approach your thought

108
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,180
life in a way that has some habits that you wanna change,

109
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,340
logic can actually help you change those dispositions and

110
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,800
develop new ones, okay?

111
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,200
So that's what intellectual virtue entails.

112
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,870
It's about developing these new dispositions, okay?

113
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:24,290
So using logic, using logical analysis

114
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,880
can help you become a critical thinker and then hopefully live

115
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:31,050
a better life because of it or have better success in life

116
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:33,810
because you've developed these skills, right.

117
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,550
So we're gonna talk about Descartes.

118
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,120
We're gonna talk about this thinker and

119
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,500
the way that he attempted to use critical thinking and

120
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,450
logic to evaluate truth, right?

121
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,250
That's really what critical thinking is all about,

122
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,270
is to get us closer to the truth, and

123
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:51,220
hopefully, the the more you're aligned with truth,

124
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,600
the more successful you're going to be.

125
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,940
So we're going to take these ideas,

126
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,740
these intellectual virtues, and I'm going to show you an example

127
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,928
of a thinker that attempted to apply these to his life and

128
00:06:02,928 --> 00:06:04,630
with the goal of getting closer the truth.

129
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,609
Now that thinker is Rene Descartes

130
00:06:07,609 --> 00:06:11,922
obviously a French Philosopher lived in Rome from

131
00:06:11,922 --> 00:06:16,310
the late 1500s to the middle of 1600s.

132
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,500
A lot of people believe that Descartes changed Western

133
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,080
thought forever.

134
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,160
His methodology, his skeptical attitude really helped define

135
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,380
modern thought for most people in the West,

136
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,425
without even knowing, most of us don't even know about this.

137
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:36,150
You may have never heard of Descartes before but he had

138
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,250
a huge influence in the way that we think about the world.

139
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:41,190
So Descartes was raised like many of us.

140
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:45,220
He was raised in a very prescribed environment.

141
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,680
He was told a lot of things as a child.

142
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,630
He was given a lot of truths,

143
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:53,700
things that he just accepted as true, from family, parents,

144
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:58,050
priests, people, friends, people in the school, instructors.

145
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,290
He was told all of these things were true and he accepted them

146
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:06,210
as true but as he got older he started realizing that some

147
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:09,220
of the things that he was told weren't actually true.

148
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,520
There was a lot of facts that people taught him

149
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,900
that he learned were not facts at all.

150
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,700
They were just opinions, or if you looked at the same fact in

151
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,490
a different way, it had a completely different meaning and

152
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,115
this really started to bother Descartes.

153
00:07:26,115 --> 00:07:28,725
Descartes was a little bit more sensitive,

154
00:07:28,725 --> 00:07:31,315
maybe than most of us, a lot of us learned about things our

155
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:33,823
parents told us or our teachers told us.

156
00:07:33,823 --> 00:07:34,975
We learned their false and we say,

157
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:37,645
okay, well, that's unfortunate, I've now learned the truth and

158
00:07:37,645 --> 00:07:38,825
I'll move on.

159
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,350
Descartes was not that way, he was really bothered by

160
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,770
the fact that all of these things that he was learning, or

161
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:48,340
a lot of the things that he was learning were either untrue, or

162
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,680
could be viewed in a different way.

163
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,780
And so he really wanted to get to a place where

164
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,710
he could change that, he wanted to get to something a little bit

165
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,737
more solid, than the methodology that he was given as a child.

166
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:05,345
Okay, so he set out to doubt everything,

167
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:08,333
that was his big insight, I guess you can call.

168
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:12,236
He really set out to doubt everything he was taught and

169
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:16,574
that methodology really changed the way that he approached

170
00:08:16,574 --> 00:08:20,057
the world and changed philosophy as we know it.

171
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:21,864
Right, so what motivated the method?

172
00:08:21,864 --> 00:08:25,000
Well, he, again, was exposed to a lot of falsities.

173
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,530
He wanted to change that.

174
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,709
And he realized that the problem was with the structure of his

175
00:08:29,709 --> 00:08:30,403
knowledge.

176
00:08:30,403 --> 00:08:32,210
It was with the structure of his knowledge.

177
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,110
The individual facts being false rather than true

178
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,640
were problematic.

179
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,832
But he realized that the method that brought

180
00:08:39,832 --> 00:08:43,115
about those falsehoods was faulty, right?

181
00:08:43,115 --> 00:08:47,826
And that's what really, really struck him, is if he were taught

182
00:08:47,826 --> 00:08:52,108
truth by his church, by his teachers, by his parents, and

183
00:08:52,108 --> 00:08:55,792
that methodology brought about the wrong result,

184
00:08:55,792 --> 00:08:58,895
we really need to look at the methodology.

185
00:08:58,895 --> 00:09:00,381
Now this is a really good example of

186
00:09:00,381 --> 00:09:01,940
critical thinking, right?

187
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,500
Descartes was raised a certain way.

188
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,770
He believed certain things based on how he was raised, and

189
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,750
the things that he was taught.

190
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,590
And he said, you know what?

191
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:12,110
This doesn't seem to be working.

192
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,730
There's a problem here.

193
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,580
And so critically,

194
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,600
he said I'm gonna adopt a different viewpoint.

195
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,880
I'm gonna take a completely different viewpoint on this.

196
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,590
I'm gonna set aside everything that I was taught as a child and

197
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,895
as a young adult, and I'm going to evaluate it.

198
00:09:25,895 --> 00:09:28,620
I'm gonna look at it critically, okay?

199
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,910
So he was then looking for a better foundation.

200
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:33,570
He wanted to look for a better methodology.

201
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,958
So in his early adulthood, he took some time off and

202
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:42,666
he hid himself away to this little cabin in a mountain.

203
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,220
I think it was called The Stove.

204
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,720
It was essentially just a one room

205
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,110
building with a large heater in it, a large stove in it.

206
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,090
And he sat there and

207
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:55,080
he thought through how he was gonna solve this problem.

208
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,890
And the way that he did this was to expose everything that he

209
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:05,180
believed to this radical doubt methodology, okay.

210
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,319
So we call this the Cartesian method, and

211
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:12,183
that's what it has become known as in philosophy.

212
00:10:12,183 --> 00:10:13,900
All right, so he was after certainty.

213
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:17,390
Now most philosophers think that certainty is a goal that

214
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:18,720
we cannot reach.

215
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,640
But Descartes, in his time in life and

216
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,980
where he was in his intellectual development, believed that

217
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,120
certainty was possible and so that was his goal was.

218
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,550
He wants to get rid of anything that he could doubt, and so

219
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,350
he's after certainty.

220
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:35,440
And again, he may have just done this as a method,

221
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,960
he may not have wanted to apply this in his life moving forward.

222
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,321
But for this time in his life,

223
00:10:40,321 --> 00:10:41,904
he said this is what I'm gonna do.

224
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:43,489
I'm gonna go after certainty.

225
00:10:43,489 --> 00:10:46,630
And so in order to get to certainty, I'm gonna look at all

226
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,033
my beliefs, all the categories of the things that I believe,

227
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:52,150
and I'm gonna subject them to doubt.

228
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,830
Can I doubt them?

229
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,630
All right, but here's a nice little quote.

230
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,210
He says reason now persuades me that I should withhold

231
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,620
my assent,

232
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:02,920
no less carefully from things which are not plainly certain.

233
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,810
There is his goal of certainty and

234
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:09,240
indubitable than I would to what is patently false.

235
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,920
All right, so he's gonna be critical of the things that he

236
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,850
holds as true, to see if they can be doubted,

237
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,430
just as he would to those things that he knows are false.

238
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,930
He's gonna doubt everything.

239
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,920
Al right, so that's the approach he took to his philosophy.

240
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,730
So he's in this cabin, he's heating things up

241
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:28,970
with his stove, he's thinking about the world.

242
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,340
He's thinking about his philosophy and

243
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:33,510
he starts to tear down everything.

244
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:35,764
Now obviously, he's got a huge problem because you can't

245
00:11:35,764 --> 00:11:37,350
go through every single belief you have.

246
00:11:37,350 --> 00:11:39,920
It would take years, if you can do it at all.

247
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,410
So you can't write down everything, I believe x,

248
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,960
I believe y, I believe z, and ask can I doubt it?

249
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,050
So what he decided to do is go after categories of beliefs,

250
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:51,800
all right, he's gonna go after the categories of things.

251
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,600
And say is the categorical area of this belief,

252
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,290
is that a solid foundation for truth and certainty, right?

253
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:02,900
So he starts out with things that he believes

254
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,210
by way of the senses.

255
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:07,740
That seems like a pretty solid area, right?

256
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,600
So he looks at all the things

257
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,280
that he believes through the senses.

258
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:14,580
I believe I see a red object, actually in the cabin he talks

259
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,025
about, he has a candle on the table and the candle's burning.

260
00:12:18,025 --> 00:12:19,975
He's looking at something beyond the candle.

261
00:12:19,975 --> 00:12:20,835
And he's like,

262
00:12:20,835 --> 00:12:25,085
I see all of these objects through my visual sensation,

263
00:12:25,085 --> 00:12:28,445
I feel the heat of the stove, I can hear the birds chirping.

264
00:12:28,445 --> 00:12:29,655
Those seem pretty solid.

265
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:31,015
But can I be deceived?

266
00:12:31,015 --> 00:12:33,090
Is it possible to doubt them?

267
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,120
Well, it only takes just a couple a minutes of thinking and

268
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,940
you say I absolutely can doubt them, right.

269
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:40,280
My senses deceive me all the time.

270
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,467
As he was looking at the candle,

271
00:12:42,467 --> 00:12:45,383
the candle flame was letting off heat, and

272
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:49,773
the object behind the heat from the candle had a different view.

273
00:12:49,773 --> 00:12:52,784
It was actually waving cuz of the heat,

274
00:12:52,784 --> 00:12:57,080
than it had if he was looking at it from the side, right?

275
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,630
It didn't have that weird sensation.

276
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:02,840
So his senses were actually providing him with inaccurate

277
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,200
information about the world.

278
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
And he said, I can absolutely doubt my senses.

279
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,300
And people get to see it all the time.

280
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:13,720
You hear something that doesn't, or you interpret what you hear

281
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:16,140
as something that doesn't actually exist, right?

282
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,320
There's something outside the house, or

283
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,970
something inside the house, whatever, okay.

284
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:22,700
So he said that's an easy category to dismiss.

285
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,700
I can doubt everything in my senses.

286
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:29,310
What about beliefs formed by reason, logic, mathematics?

287
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:34,057
Those have to be solid, right, those have to be beyond doubt.

288
00:13:34,057 --> 00:13:36,684
1 plus 1 equals 2 all the time.

289
00:13:36,684 --> 00:13:41,240
There's no situation where it actually ever does not

290
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:44,985
equal two, so that seems like a really solid

291
00:13:44,985 --> 00:13:48,239
place to go in terms of finding truth.

292
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:50,856
As he thought about this, for many pages in his journal,

293
00:13:50,856 --> 00:13:52,280
he says, I think I've got it.

294
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,185
I think I've found the foundation.

295
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:56,100
Mathematics has got to be it.

296
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:59,020
There's no way that I can come up with a counterexample

297
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,920
to these mathematical principles that I've learned.

298
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,420
And then he stumbled upon something.

299
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:05,690
He said,

300
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:11,490
I actually can be deceived by things that I learn from reason.

301
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:13,294
How is that possible?

302
00:14:13,294 --> 00:14:17,546
He said what if I'm being deceived by what he termed as

303
00:14:17,546 --> 00:14:18,777
an evil demon?

304
00:14:18,777 --> 00:14:22,639
What if there's this malevolent demon out there and

305
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,050
he is tricking me?

306
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:26,834
And he invented this whole system of mathematics,

307
00:14:26,834 --> 00:14:29,164
this whole system of logic, to trick me and

308
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:31,500
think that it's absolutely true.

309
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,250
Provide no way around it, no way of finding falsehood,

310
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,970
but the whole system is completely made up.

311
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:40,590
And the real world doesn't operate that way at all.

312
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,530
If you've ever seen the movie The Matrix,

313
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,320
that movie kind of plays on this idea, right, that Cartesian

314
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,220
being duped like Descartes thought he probably was duped or

315
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,720
possibly was duped, right?

316
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,440
Our whole mental life could be a fabrication by an evil demon or

317
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,530
a mad scientist or whatever.

318
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,237
And so there's really no way to disprove it.

319
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:06,068
If the evil demon, the math scientist is deceiving me,

320
00:15:06,068 --> 00:15:10,144
I have no way of disproving that that demon is deceiving me,

321
00:15:10,144 --> 00:15:12,530
that I'm being tricked.

322
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,580
Cuz you can never get outside of that trickery

323
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,580
to learn that you're being tricked.

324
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:21,400
So he ended up having to dismiss mathematics.

325
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:24,090
He ended up having dismissed the fundamental laws of logic,

326
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,380
he said reason is not indubitable.

327
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,032
I can certainly doubt reason, and

328
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:34,514
the evil demon will approach, the evil demon construct,

329
00:15:34,514 --> 00:15:39,100
if you will, is the way that he said that that's possible.

330
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,110
So now he's struggling, right?

331
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,320
I mean, if you can't trust your senses,

332
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,820
you can't trust mathematics, you can't trust logic.

333
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,520
He obviously knows that he can't trust all the facts that he was

334
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,090
given by parents and teachers, right?

335
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,060
Those are certainly open to doubt, cuz he's found

336
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,200
that a lot of those are wrong, or incorrect, or untrue.

337
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,160
Now he's stuck, where do you go from here?

338
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:04,870
There is really no foundation, there is really no other area,

339
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,710
there is no other category that you can run to where you could

340
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:13,350
have these indubitable ideas, these ideas behind doubt.

341
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:16,123
Well, he did stumble upon something as you probably knew I

342
00:16:16,123 --> 00:16:17,207
was going to tell you.

343
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,094
He actually found what he would consider pay dirt.

344
00:16:20,094 --> 00:16:24,244
He found a rock solid foundation that not even the evil demon

345
00:16:24,244 --> 00:16:25,660
could trick him on.

346
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:31,960
And that foundation is that he was thinking.

347
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,893
He said as I'm going through this exercise, I have to find

348
00:16:35,893 --> 00:16:39,748
the one thing that I can build my whole system upon Not even

349
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:44,190
the evil demon can trick me on, and that's that he was doubting.

350
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,750
So he actually put this to the test.

351
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,720
Playing the role of a critical thinker, he said,

352
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,870
I know that I'm thinking, I seem to be doubting,

353
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:56,620
I'm going through this process, could I doubt that I'm doubting?

354
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,340
That just seems like a reasonable question for

355
00:16:58,340 --> 00:16:59,730
a critical thinker to ask.

356
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,480
Is it possible to doubt that I'm doubting?

357
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,770
And he said, in order for

358
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,970
me to be doubting, I have to be thinking.

359
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:12,570
And to doubt that I'm a thinking thing would be a contradiction.

360
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:15,160
You can't doubt that you're a thinking thing because then

361
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,560
you're thinking in order to doubt.

362
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,430
So as he thought more about this he said,

363
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:21,370
that's impossible to fake.

364
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:25,460
Even if there is an evil demon tricking me about everything

365
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,690
else, I still have to be a thinking thing

366
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,260
in order to be tricked by the evil demon.

367
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,030
So the one thing that is beyond doubt,

368
00:17:35,030 --> 00:17:37,270
that is beyond critical analysis,

369
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:41,520
that cannot be proven false, is that I'm a thinking thing.

370
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,000
I am a thing that thinks.

371
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,238
And that's where Descartes came up with his famous phrase,

372
00:17:47,238 --> 00:17:53,280
[FOREIGN], I think, therefore I am.

373
00:17:54,525 --> 00:17:58,380
Now this does not mean that Descartes is somehow

374
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,030
thinking himself into existence, it's not a claim of being,

375
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:06,090
it's not a claim of existence, it's a claim of knowledge.

376
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:08,350
Another way to say this is,

377
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,370
I think, therefore I know that I am.

378
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:15,280
I think therefore I can be certain that I'm a thinking

379
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,350
thing, that I exist.

380
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,030
It's impossible to doubt that I am a thinking existing thing.

381
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:25,120
And Descartes saw this phrase,

382
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,600
saw this idea, as a foundation for all of knowledge.

383
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,876
And he built up a system of knowledge just using this very

384
00:18:32,876 --> 00:18:36,570
seemingly modest idea, I'm a thinking thing, I cannot doubt

385
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:39,776
it, therefore there has to be something that exists,

386
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:41,676
there has to be something real.

387
00:18:41,676 --> 00:18:44,306
Now, a lot of people disagree with the next move Descartes

388
00:18:44,306 --> 00:18:46,980
made and how we built up this system from this phrase.

389
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,200
But the point of this lecture, the point of this lesson,

390
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:54,090
is that Descartes applied a critical methodology,

391
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,460
an analytic methodology as a critical thinker.

392
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,670
And I'm using this to show how you can use that methodology to

393
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:06,640
subject even your most foundational beliefs to analysis

394
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:12,140
and to come up with a way of getting around doubts and

395
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,780
falsehoods.

396
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:15,050
So he was willing to do this,

397
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:19,040
he was willing to expose his beliefs, everything he believed,

398
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,420
even the foundation of his beliefs, to critical thought to

399
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:27,440
analyze them, and by doing that, he actually ended up changing

400
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,130
western though, hopefully for the better in the long run.

401
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,210
So even if you don't agree with Descartes' approach,

402
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:36,310
you don't think that he actually discovered anything interesting,

403
00:19:36,310 --> 00:19:39,680
the point of this lesson is about the methodology.

404
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,270
It's about taking your cherished beliefs,

405
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:44,870
taking the things you've been taught all your life, and

406
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:47,760
exposing them to the light of doubt.

407
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,280
To asking yourself, is this really true?

408
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:53,060
Is what I'm hearing on television actually the case?

409
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:56,080
Is what this politician is saying, even if you like

410
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,670
the politician, is that person actually giving me what is true?

411
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:01,760
Or do I need to think about it more?

412
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,130
This is what critical thinking is all about.

413
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:08,055
And in the the upcoming lessons in this module, we're

414
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:11,050
gonna walk you through some of the tools that you can use to be

415
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,650
a better critical thinker.

416
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:15,040
Taking the logical analysis that we've done in the first few

417
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,950
modules, and then applying them to problems in the real world.
