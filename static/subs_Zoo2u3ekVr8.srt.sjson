And so Global Distribution","as here means forgetting very,","very low latency no matter","what region the user is located in.","However, the database itself is","also designed to handle a very,","very high ingestion and then do","synchronous indexes as rights","come in and immediately save them back out.","And this is a completely lache free database,","and as a result what you get out of this","is a very predictable performance,","and once you get low latency no matter how high","the ingestion or how high the requests volume is.","On top of this,","just speaking of ingestion,","this is both to elastically scale out.",">> So elastic scale. That sounds like is","related to Global Distribution.","Can we scale globally in an elastic manner?","What is elastic scale, does it even starts?",">>Yes. So when you think","about scaling out there's","actually two means of scaling out.","One is replication and the other is partitioning.","Global Distribution has all to do with replication.","However, in order to really deliver capabilities to","handle massive amounts of","storage as well as massive amounts of throughput,","just think about sheer amount of rights per second,","rates per second coming in,","the other means for doing this","is actually partition that database.","And the awesome thing about","Cosmos DB is partition management is actually","taken by half from you and becomes","owned by the service itself","so that you don't have to worry","about partition management.","If you need to go from let's say","100 partitions to 200 partitions,","and you don't want to sacrifice","availability, don't worry,","Cosmos DB will actually do that work for","you and you can dynamically scale on demand.",">>Yeah, it sounds like a managed service to me,","because you can say it does quite a lot for you.",">>And so that is exactly correct.","It's a fully-managed service and it's","backed by a comprehensive SLA's.","SLA's you can think of as service level agreements.","That means that it has","a financially backed guarantee on these capabilities,","and so actually guarantees","the consistency level that you choose.","It guarantees and has SLA's on low latency.","So, instead of just saying,","hey on average or by median,","that the database performs well,","we actually have an SLA on worst case,","the p99 latency for the database service.","So you can actually get very,","very predictable performance out of it,","and of course the throughput that you provision.","This is a provisioned model,","meaning any resources that","you provision are actually","set aside and dedicated to you.","So, this isn't a scale target that sometimes you can hit,","sometimes you cannot hit,","but rather you actually","guaranteed that performance and","those resources are set aside,","so you can always hit","whatever scale targets you need to achieve.","So this is the underlying platform","that cosmos DB is built on top of,","and what we do is we actually built","a multi-model database where we can","project different non-relational data models","on top of the underlying platform.","And so, on the platform itself,","we have our own way of representing","the data called atom record sequence,","and it's just a fancy way of saying","that we're able to build self-describing,","scheme agnostic representations of that data.","On top of this we can actually","project the key value data model,","the document oriented data model,","a graph data model,","or a column oriented data model",">> So you hit all of the.",">>Best hits.",">>From the non SQL one right there.",">>Yes. And so this way rather than having","to force and choose a single data model,","this is a truly multi-model database.","And the beauty of that is,","if you've ever had to stand up let's say","a graph database alongside a document oriented database,","you're basically learning two pieces of technology,","managing two pieces of technology,","and you're maintaining consistency between","two separate data stores which is incredibly challenging.","In this model what you can do","is you can have a single data set,","exposed by multiple different data models,","and this allows you to interact and build really,","really rich scenarios off with this.","And so this is exposed","through a variety of different API's,","including a Tables API, a DocumentDB API,","a MongoDB API,","a Gremlin API,","and then in the future we will also be adding","a column oriented data model","or API on top of this as well.","And so this kind of gives you a full gambit of","different ways of interacting","with the underlying platform.",">>I was going to say this is very exciting,","and seems like with","the different models and different API's,","it gives you the capability to expand,","and one day as different models come out,","different API's become popular,","adapt and adjust to those so","that if I make an investment in","Cosmos DB as a developer or a database professional,","I don't have to make another investment in","another platform in the future","just because something becomes popular.","So it sounds really exciting,","I'm very excited to dig deeper and","learn a lot more about Cosmos DB."]}
