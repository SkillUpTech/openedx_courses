00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:03,860
So far we've been looking at how arguments are constructed.

1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:05,802
I've been trying to give you a toolkit for

2
00:00:05,802 --> 00:00:07,252
putting arguments together.

3
00:00:07,252 --> 00:00:11,592
We've looked at statements, propositions and truth value.

4
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:14,630
Those are the basic building blocks of a logical argument.

5
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:15,600
And now we wanna put

6
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,730
those things into a specific structure.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:20,530
We wanna put statements, which symbolize propositions,

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,330
into a structure so that you can actually make an argument.

9
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,672
And that's what we're gonna look at next, argument structure.

10
00:00:26,672 --> 00:00:30,216
All right, a good logical argument, as I said in

11
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:34,280
a previous lesson, a good logical argument is premises

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:38,630
that relate to a conclusion in a very specific way.

13
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,440
So we call an argument that has that relation

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,340
a proper logical relation.

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,740
The premises have to lead to the conclusion.

16
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:50,110
The conclusion has to come from the premises, all right?

17
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,040
In order for that to happen,

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,520
arguments have to be structured in a very specific way so

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,170
that the premises do lead to the conclusion, and

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,110
that structure is called argument form.

21
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,610
And we're gonna be looking at a couple of different ways that we

22
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:08,650
can construct these arguments using very specific forms.

23
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:10,898
And I'll give you those in a later lesson.

24
00:01:10,898 --> 00:01:14,090
Right, so well-formed arguments, and we're gonna talk about

25
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:16,855
deductive, which is a very specific type of argument.

26
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:19,980
Well-formed, deductive arguments have a term.

27
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:24,710
When the premises relate to the conclusion in the right way,

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,600
when it's a properly formed argument,

29
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,300
we call those arguments valid arguments.

30
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:33,211
If you're an English speaker,

31
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:35,792
the term valid many times refers to a good argument.

32
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,311
Like if someone gives you an argument, and you believe

33
00:01:38,311 --> 00:01:41,780
the conclusion is true you say, well, that argument's valid.

34
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,350
That person made his or her point.

35
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,040
That's not how it's used in logic.

36
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,440
It's used a little bit differently.

37
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:52,567
All validity refers to is the form of the argument, whether or

38
00:01:52,567 --> 00:01:58,870
not the premises are related to the conclusion in the right way.

39
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:03,720
And conversely, poorly formed arguments are called invalid.

40
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,440
And I'll give you an example of these in just a moment.

41
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,020
But poorly-formed arguments are called invalid.

42
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,540
Properly formed arguments are called valid.

43
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,290
Do not think of the term valid to refer to whether an argument

44
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:20,265
makes its case, whether the argument's conclusion is true or

45
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:20,790
false.

46
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:23,130
And that's the point of the second bullet here.

47
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,273
Validity has nothing to do with truth value at this point.

48
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:27,795
At least for deductive arguments,

49
00:02:27,795 --> 00:02:29,732
validity has nothing to do with truth value.

50
00:02:29,732 --> 00:02:34,431
Whether the claims of the premises are true, okay?

51
00:02:34,431 --> 00:02:35,677
Argument form then,

52
00:02:35,677 --> 00:02:39,136
validity is only one part of what makes a good argument, and

53
00:02:39,136 --> 00:02:42,810
we're gonna just focus on that one part for right now.

54
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:45,170
All we're talking about is how to put the premises and

55
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:47,720
the conclusion together to make a good argument, and

56
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,690
argument form is one part of that.

57
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,560
So I want you to practice using the term valid

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,720
to refer to argument structure or

59
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:58,850
form, not whether the whole argument is good or bad.

60
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:01,100
We'll talk about that term later on.

61
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,357
Let me give you some examples that may help make this

62
00:03:04,357 --> 00:03:05,352
clear, okay?

63
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:08,120
Here's an argument in a specific form.

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,530
It says, if you program computers

65
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:12,090
then you're familiar with JavaScript.

66
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:17,450
You're familiar with JavaScript, therefore you program computers.

67
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,560
Now there's something wrong with this argument.

68
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,420
This is not in the proper form.

69
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:26,871
And what this means is, based on what we claim in this first

70
00:03:26,871 --> 00:03:30,321
premise, and based on what we claim in the second premise,

71
00:03:30,321 --> 00:03:32,331
we cannot get to this conclusion.

72
00:03:32,331 --> 00:03:36,100
These two premises do not lead to this conclusion.

73
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,390
You might wanna pause the video for a moment and just study that

74
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,760
argument for a second to see if you can tell what's going on.

75
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,990
Why this argument really doesn't work.

76
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:49,780
I'm gonna give you another argument in the same exact form,

77
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,270
this is an invalid form.

78
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,970
I'm gonna give you another argument that may illustrate it

79
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,911
a little bit more clearly.

80
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,730
This one says, if Alan Turing,

81
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,950
the famous computer scientist, developed the Turing machine or

82
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:06,020
the Turing machine was a machine that was named after him,

83
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,880
a concept that was named after him.

84
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,670
If Alan Turning died in 1954, then he was born in or

85
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,074
prior to 1954.

86
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,203
The second premise is Alan Turing was born in or

87
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:19,511
prior to 1954.

88
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:24,050
The conclusion therefore, Alan Turing died in 1954.

89
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,740
Now notice just because Alan Turing was born in or prior

90
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,790
to 1954, it doesn't necessarily mean that he died in 1954,

91
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:35,350
given what we said in the first premise.

92
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:38,590
Those two premises do not lead to that conclusion

93
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:40,700
because the form is invalid.

94
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,673
We cannot draw this conclusion from these two premises.

95
00:04:44,673 --> 00:04:45,854
So how would we fix it?

96
00:04:45,854 --> 00:04:49,572
Well, we'd fix it by changing the argument structure to

97
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:53,294
the right form, and let me show you what that looks like.

98
00:04:53,294 --> 00:04:56,690
Here we have the proper argument form.

99
00:04:56,690 --> 00:05:01,440
This argument has the same exact first premise.

100
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,320
If Alan Turing died in 1954, then he was born in or

101
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,413
prior to 1954.

102
00:05:05,413 --> 00:05:11,051
Then our second premise says, Alan Turing died in 1954.

103
00:05:11,051 --> 00:05:12,556
So we can then conclude,

104
00:05:12,556 --> 00:05:16,571
based on what we learned in the first premise, that, therefore,

105
00:05:16,571 --> 00:05:19,312
Alan Turing was born in or prior to 1954.

106
00:05:19,312 --> 00:05:22,081
Notice what we've done here is we've taken,

107
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:25,844
in the second version of this argument, we've taken the first

108
00:05:25,844 --> 00:05:29,536
part of the if statement in the first premise and asserted that

109
00:05:29,536 --> 00:05:33,015
as the second premise, and then concluded the second part

110
00:05:33,015 --> 00:05:36,092
of the if statement from the first premise, okay?

111
00:05:36,092 --> 00:05:40,992
And this is a proper form and you can see how, based on these

112
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:46,204
first two premises, we can conclude that final conclusion.

113
00:05:46,204 --> 00:05:49,838
The premises lead to the conclusion based on what's

114
00:05:49,838 --> 00:05:51,744
claimed here, all right?

115
00:05:51,744 --> 00:05:54,624
And then the one just prior, the one in yellow here,

116
00:05:54,624 --> 00:05:55,746
that does not work.

117
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:57,724
That does not happen, all right?

118
00:05:57,724 --> 00:06:00,358
I'm gonna very quickly give you the names for these arguments.

119
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:04,658
Logicians have given Latin names to these structures.

120
00:06:04,658 --> 00:06:07,341
And I'll give those to you and then later on in the course I'll

121
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:09,158
teach you how to construct these, okay?

122
00:06:09,158 --> 00:06:12,467
This last argument here is called the modus ponens

123
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:16,830
argument, a modus ponens argument, the mode of putting.

124
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:18,693
We're asserting something in the second premise.

125
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:21,073
And this is a valid logical form.

126
00:06:21,073 --> 00:06:24,314
And you can put any argument into this form and

127
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:28,073
it would be valid, even if the premises were false.

128
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,313
Let me say that again.

129
00:06:29,313 --> 00:06:32,104
You could put any argument into this form and

130
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:35,730
it would be valid even if the premises were false.

131
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:39,332
The second argument is an invalid form of the modus

132
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:42,163
ponens, and it's called asserting or

133
00:06:42,163 --> 00:06:45,081
affirming the consequent fallacy, and

134
00:06:45,081 --> 00:06:48,370
we'll learn more about that later on.

135
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:51,241
But this is an invalid form and it's always invalid

136
00:06:51,241 --> 00:06:54,323
regardless of what you plug into the premises, okay?

137
00:06:54,323 --> 00:06:57,652
So what we're learning here is that the form of the argument

138
00:06:57,652 --> 00:07:00,125
matters in helping determine truth value.

139
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:03,240
And the first step in constructing good arguments is

140
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,225
to make sure that your argument is in a valid form.

141
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:08,983
I'm gonna teach you some valid forms later on in the course.

142
00:07:08,983 --> 00:07:13,533
The lesson right now is just to think about and to look at those

143
00:07:13,533 --> 00:07:17,205
forms to make sure that they are properly valid.
