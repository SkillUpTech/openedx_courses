00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:03,584
So we've been looking at how to construct arguments,

1
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:06,084
we've looked at statements which are grammatical,

2
00:00:06,084 --> 00:00:08,250
linguistic declarations of truth.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:12,150
We've looked at propositions which are the actual thing that

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,600
is true or false, and statements symbolize those propositions.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,074
And now we wanna look at truth value.

6
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:19,510
I said then in an earlier lesson,

7
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:23,470
that logic is all about getting to the truth of a statement or

8
00:00:23,470 --> 00:00:26,670
a claim, and so we wanna look at what truth value

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:29,760
is now in constructing arguments, right?

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,300
So when we're talking about propositions,

11
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:36,500
which is the meaning behind any declarative statement we make,

12
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:40,260
those propositions can either be true or false in logic,

13
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:41,360
all right?

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,780
So when we're creating a logical argument,

15
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,730
any statement is going to be or

16
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,440
any proposition is either going to be true or false.

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,490
It can only be one or the other.

18
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,270
It can't be neither and it can't be both.

19
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,280
So what do you do when you don't know what the truth value is of

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,260
a statement in logic?

21
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,340
Well, you always assume it's true and

22
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,500
see whether the argument works, okay?

23
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:05,880
And then, obviously the goal is gonna be to try to find out

24
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,662
whether your premises actually are true.

25
00:01:08,662 --> 00:01:12,100
All right, so Seattle is located in New York.

26
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,470
That is a statement of truth.

27
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,460
If you know where Seattle is located you're gonna know

28
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,750
that that's a false statement.

29
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:20,230
So, we would give it a value of false or F.

30
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,430
Ice is frozen.

31
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:26,110
Again, not parsing terms here, we're just gonna say ice is

32
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:28,950
frozen is a declarative statement that is

33
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,610
by definition true.

34
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,170
Ice is frozen water, okay?

35
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,080
Now again, suppose you didn't know whether

36
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,030
ice is frozen, right?

37
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:40,237
It doesn't really matter in logic cuz what you can do is

38
00:01:40,237 --> 00:01:41,711
assume that it's true.

39
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:45,297
Plug it into your argument, and you'll see how this works later,

40
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:46,898
plug it into your argument and

41
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:49,541
see if the actual argument goes through, okay?

42
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:52,651
So this what we're talking about when we're talking about truth

43
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:54,234
value, whether the statement,

44
00:01:54,234 --> 00:01:56,390
the declarative statement is true or false.

45
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,655
These are obviously simple statements as we learned in

46
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:03,850
an earlier lesson and each is gonna have a truth value, right?

47
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:06,050
Now, what I'd like to do is quickly summarize

48
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,990
what we've covered so far.

49
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,350
So we talked about statements as linguistic or grammatical.

50
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,380
They're written or spoken,

51
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,320
that's all we mean by linguistic.

52
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,720
Propositions are not linguistic, they are the things that

53
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,600
are being symbolized by the sentences.

54
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,810
Statements then are the symbol,

55
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,870
the propositions are the thing that actually have meaning.

56
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:33,300
And then propositions themselves can be true or false, statements

57
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:36,330
cannot be true or false because they're just the symbols for

58
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,850
the things that are, all right?

59
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:41,450
So the big takeaway is, remember that statements express

60
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:44,610
propositions and propositions are true or false.

61
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:48,904
So, those are basic tools for constructing logical arguments.

62
00:02:48,904 --> 00:02:53,325
We're gonna write statements that symbolize the meaning as

63
00:02:53,325 --> 00:02:55,405
best as we possibly can, and

64
00:02:55,405 --> 00:02:58,711
then we're gonna assign them a truth value.

65
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:01,605
And as we get further into the lessons, you're gonna see how

66
00:03:01,605 --> 00:03:04,350
all of this works together to create logical arguments.
