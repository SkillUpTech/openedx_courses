00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,280
In this lesson we're gonna be looking at what logic is.

1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,790
So this is gonna start from the very very basics and

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:09,670
we're gonna talk about the discipline of formal logic.

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:14,140
So logic is a science that was discovered by Aristotle

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,270
in the early 400 BC timeframe.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,680
Aristotle was one of the three major Greek thinkers

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:23,730
of that period.

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,290
The three thinkers were Aristotle, Plato, and Socrates,

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:31,760
and the way that I generally remember those three men

9
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,810
is that Socrates came first and his name starts with the letter

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,110
of the alphabet that's furthest down in the In the list, so

11
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,190
we have S for Socrates and he came first.

12
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,610
In the middle was Plato and P is somewhere in the middle of

13
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:50,860
the alphabet and Socrates was Plato's teacher.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,710
And then Plato taught Aristotle and

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:54,740
Aristotle is at the beginning of the alphabet in terms of

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,590
the first letter of his name.

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,960
And he came last in line.

18
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,950
So Socrates, Plato, Aristotle in its reverse alphabetical order.

19
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,970
So Aristotle really was the person that we credit with

20
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,480
discovering formal logic.

21
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,730
And the way that I'm describing logic here is that

22
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,040
it's a system of right reasoning.

23
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,380
It's a system of right reasoning.

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:17,690
Now, the term right sometimes throws people off.

25
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:21,410
What does it mean to reason rightly or reason properly?

26
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:24,030
And I guess the best way to think about this is that

27
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,820
when I talk about right reasoning,

28
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,920
it's sorta like doing mathematics, right?

29
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,410
There's a right way to do mathematics and

30
00:01:29,410 --> 00:01:30,810
a wrong way to do mathematics.

31
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:34,780
1 plus 1 does not equal 5 and it will never equal 5.

32
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:37,900
So what logic tries to teach us is that there's a right way that

33
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,730
idea should relate to one another particularly when you're

34
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:42,880
trying to make an argument which we'll look at later.

35
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,160
And that's what logic really studies and

36
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:46,260
released the discovery of.

37
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:47,750
All right, so

38
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:52,640
logic then is a form of science and it really tries to

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,470
capture the ways that idea should relate to one another.

40
00:01:56,470 --> 00:02:00,110
So to put in other way, when we're studying logic,

41
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:01,440
we're studying rules.

42
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,680
We're studying rules of the ways that ideas should relate.

43
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,490
These rules, at least for our purposes,

44
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,860
are going to be called syllogisms.

45
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,090
This is the name that logicians have given these rules, and

46
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:14,139
they again describe the correct way that ideas should relate.

47
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:18,220
The other thing that logic studies is what's called

48
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,160
truth values.

49
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,960
We'll spend some more time on this later in the course.

50
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,380
But all truth value means is the role that truth

51
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,235
plays in correct reasoning.

52
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:29,835
Some ideas are true, some ideas are false.

53
00:02:29,835 --> 00:02:32,795
And the goal as thinkers is to try to figure out

54
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:33,655
which is which.

55
00:02:33,655 --> 00:02:36,545
We wanna have more true beliefs than false beliefs.

56
00:02:36,545 --> 00:02:38,815
And logic helps us get to truth value.

57
00:02:38,815 --> 00:02:42,505
It helps us determine whether some ideas are truthful and

58
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:43,359
some ideas are false.

59
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:49,440
Syllogisms then are the rules that we use to construct

60
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,640
the arguments that help us determine which ideas are true

61
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,670
and false.

62
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,670
And you're gonna see how this works as we move throughout

63
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:58,860
the course as we construct these syllogisms, we're gonna

64
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,880
gain some insight into the truthfulness of the arguments

65
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,410
that we're making or the arguments that we're hearing.

66
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:08,810
So the rules themselves actually can help us understand

67
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:10,850
whether we're dealing with truth of falsity.

68
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:16,460
There's also a whole field of study in logic that studies

69
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:19,830
incorrect reasoning, and these are called fallacies.

70
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:21,880
We're not gonna spend a ton of time on fallacies in

71
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,830
this course, but fallacious reasoning is improper reasoning.

72
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,920
This is the other side of the correct reasoning that

73
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
we've talked about.

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,799
And when you're reasoning in properly you're reasoning

75
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:33,730
fallaciously according to logicians.

76
00:03:33,730 --> 00:03:37,480
So there's a feel of study where you can learn to recognize

77
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,590
false arguments.

78
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,270
I'll talk about a few fallacies and a course and you'll see how

79
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:45,800
these work, but we're not gonna spend a ton of time on that.

80
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,940
So logic is a science, logic is research,

81
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,570
it's discovery, it's not invention.

82
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,970
Aristotle discovered the rules of logic, wrote them down,

83
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,630
and we've been studying them ever since.

84
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,520
So that is essentially what logic is and

85
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,387
throughout this course you're going to learn some of those

86
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,350
rules and how to apply them to problems.
