And what we'll be doing","is for our roadmap is starting to kick","off audits for Level D","and over time what you'll see is actually Cosmos DB,","moved down to the level D stage.","Now this also gives you kind of","an idea of broadly speaking,","how Azure products approach compliance.","So all of them follow this kind of planning in terms of","the roadmap for compliance certifications.","And I mean what's really cool and neat","about Cosmos DB is we","already use this as a ring 0","foundational core service within Microsoft.","By Ring 0, what I mean by that is,","our model is we establish","these rings and a Ring 0 service can only make","dependencies on Ring 0 whereas Ring 1 can make","dependencies on Ring 0 or Ring 1.","The idea here is,","if you have a few regions or fewer LSRs,","you cannot make a dependency","on something that requires higher LSRs more","regions where even stricter compliance","cannot make a dependency","on something that has less, right?","For Cosmos DB, this is already","a foundational Microsoft technology.","We use it throughout Microsoft and because of this we are","always going to be on the fast train for getting","these kind of things done and as regions brought out.","I mean this is a pretty core piece of technology we have.",">> And I was going to ask, now that you going to level D,","is this the type of thing where we'll get","a level D from a local state agency","or a government agency,","I can start looking at Cosmos DB as","the platform for my database applications moving forward?",">> Yes. And what's kind","of nice is because we've gone through all of","this audit process and getting","certification or testification on our end,","what that means is that for","your application as you go and embark on this journey,","it makes it a lot smoother and easier for you.","You can go to the Microsoft Trust Center,","that is the authoritative website where all of this is","covered and from there","you can actually download the reports,","our audit reports and make","sure that you can then leverage all of the work","that we've done for you","to get your application also signed off.",">>Yes definitely. If you want to read more about this,","learn more about this,","we definitely can recommend","going to the Azure Trust Center,","this is just for all Azure services,","not just for a Cosmos DB.","If you're watching this video obviously,","August 2017 is what we're talking about and","you want to see how far along we are with Cosmos DB.","You can definitely just","go to Trust Center to see what Cosmos DB is,","see the audit reports and","everything Andrew just shared with you."]}
