00:00:01,050 --> 00:00:04,060
In a previous lesson we introduced to you

1
00:00:04,060 --> 00:00:05,740
conditional statements.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:10,251
A conditional operator joins two simple statements by the phrase

3
00:00:10,251 --> 00:00:11,158
if and then.

4
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:12,606
And I wanna spend a little bit more

5
00:00:12,606 --> 00:00:15,404
time talking about conditional statements because they're so

6
00:00:15,404 --> 00:00:18,400
important in constructing logical arguments.

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,470
As I said, a conditional statement has the structure

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,450
if then.

9
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,540
If simple statement, then another simple statement.

10
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:29,230
And when we construct these conditional statements,

11
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:34,880
these conditional sentences, what we're doing is portraying

12
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:39,410
a relationship between the antecedent which follows the if

13
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:42,990
and the consequent which follows the then, right?

14
00:00:42,990 --> 00:00:47,360
Conditional statements in and of themselves are not arguments.

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,630
They are part of an argument.

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,070
We can use them as a premise in an overall argument.

17
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,050
They're not arguments themselves.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,273
And what conditional statements do is set up

19
00:00:57,273 --> 00:01:00,060
a relationship that we can analyze and

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,342
then use to determine truth value of an overall argument.

21
00:01:04,342 --> 00:01:06,360
Let me give you an example, all right?

22
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,370
So the relationship then that exists between the antecedent

23
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:12,960
and the consequent can be used to set up your argument.

24
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,910
So if we have a premise like this, this is a conditional,

25
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:19,640
which we just looked at, it's an if then structure.

26
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,330
If iron is less dense than mercury,

27
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,350
then it will float in water.

28
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:25,300
What does this tell us?

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,740
Well it tells us something very specific about the relationship

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,700
between the density of mercury and whether it will

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,670
float in water and the density of the water, all right?

32
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,300
We can then make a second premise,

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,110
iron is actually less dense than mercury.

34
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:43,528
And we can conclude, therefore it will float in water, right?

35
00:01:43,528 --> 00:01:46,772
So this relationship is determined

36
00:01:46,772 --> 00:01:51,220
by this conditional in the first premise.

37
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,450
What this tells us is, if iron as an element is less

38
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:01,210
dense than mercury, then it must be true that it floats in water.

39
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,400
That's what the first premise tells us.

40
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,912
It doesn't tell us that that's actually true.

41
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:08,870
What it's saying, though, is that this is the condition that

42
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:11,830
must follow if iron is less dense than mercury.

43
00:02:11,830 --> 00:02:14,480
Namely, it will float in water.

44
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:18,580
Right, so it sets up the condition for our conclusion,

45
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,830
for what must be true in the conclusion.

46
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,590
All right, here's another example.

47
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,029
This is something we saw earlier.

48
00:02:26,029 --> 00:02:29,368
If Alan Turing died in 1954, then he was born in or

49
00:02:29,368 --> 00:02:33,524
prior to 1954, so I can promise Alan Turing died in 1954,

50
00:02:33,524 --> 00:02:36,585
therefore, he was born in or prior to 1954.

51
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:42,073
What we have here, in the first premise, in the conditional

52
00:02:42,073 --> 00:02:46,272
is the relationship between the antecedent,

53
00:02:46,272 --> 00:02:51,762
Alan Turing died in 1954 and its subsequent consequence

54
00:02:51,762 --> 00:02:56,840
about what must be true if Alan Turing died in 1954.

55
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,668
And that relationship is an expression of what are called

56
00:03:00,668 --> 00:03:04,257
necessary and sufficient conditions, necessary or

57
00:03:04,257 --> 00:03:06,823
sufficient conditions, all right?

58
00:03:06,823 --> 00:03:10,220
A necessary condition, very simply, is what must be true.

59
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,803
It's what is necessary.

60
00:03:11,803 --> 00:03:15,082
And we can also say what is necessary or impossible.

61
00:03:15,082 --> 00:03:17,929
A sufficient condition is what could be true,

62
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:19,464
what's possibly true.

63
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:23,942
Now, let's look at this again with these ideas in mind.

64
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:29,550
All right, Alan Turing dying in 1954 is a possible scenario.

65
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,710
It's what could be true.

66
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,940
But what we're claiming is that if, in fact,

67
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,990
that is true, the consequent, he was born in or

68
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:43,000
prior to 1954 must follow with logical necessity.

69
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Put another way, what we're claiming in the first premise

70
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,192
is if the antecedent is true,

71
00:03:48,192 --> 00:03:52,470
it's impossible that the consequent be false.

72
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:54,660
That's what the necessary condition is.

73
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,500
So the consequent always states the necessary condition.

74
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,890
The antecedent always states the sufficient or

75
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,910
the possible condition.

76
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:09,470
That's why, in the second premise, if we do in fact assert

77
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,980
Alan Turing died in 1954, if we make that claim as

78
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,370
actually true, that's what we're doing in the second premise.

79
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,070
It has to follow with logical necessity

80
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:22,750
that Alan Turing was born in or prior to 1954.

81
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:26,180
Because the first premise tells us

82
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,250
the consequent must be true if the antecedent is true.

83
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,100
And that's how conditionals work.

84
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,770
They state necessary and sufficient conditions and it

85
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:40,270
helps us actually with defining what must be true in the world.

86
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:43,240
So for example, you can ask what must be true for

87
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,270
a thing to be a human being?

88
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,490
Or what must be true for

89
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:51,710
a certain condition to take place, right?

90
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,710
You can state those in terms of conditionals.

91
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,860
And then you can say if the antecedent is true,

92
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,060
the consequent must follow.

93
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,076
And that's the magic, that's the importance of conditionals.
