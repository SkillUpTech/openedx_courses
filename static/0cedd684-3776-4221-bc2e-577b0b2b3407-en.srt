00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
>> Hi and welcome back.

1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:05,670
I'm having a discussion with Dr. Paul Herrick.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:08,010
Dr. Herrick is the author of the textbook that

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,700
we've been using in our course, Think with Socrates.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,050
In the first video,

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,395
we discussed a little bit about Dr. Herrick's

6
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:17,455
authoring of his three Logic texts.

7
00:00:17,455 --> 00:00:19,515
And then this wonderful book

8
00:00:19,515 --> 00:00:21,795
on Socrates on critical thinking.

9
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:24,870
Dr.Herrick, I want to turn the topic a little bit now

10
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:28,265
to the practical side of teaching Logic.

11
00:00:28,265 --> 00:00:30,525
A lot of students haven't gone through this course.

12
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:32,396
I've taught this course now for two quarters,

13
00:00:32,396 --> 00:00:34,075
Logic and Computational Thinking,

14
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,330
and at some point students get bogged down.

15
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:39,495
They just run into some conceptual issues.

16
00:00:39,495 --> 00:00:40,860
And I see students kind of dropping

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,115
off or dropping out of the course

18
00:00:42,115 --> 00:00:43,470
because the concepts get a little bit too

19
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,080
challenging, a little bit too difficult.

20
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,090
You said in the last video you've taught Logic in

21
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:49,320
the classroom and online for

22
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,780
35 years which is a long time, a lot longer than I have.

23
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,170
I wanted to see if you have any guidance.

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:57,731
So as students get into this work,

25
00:00:57,731 --> 00:00:59,220
what kinds of challenges do you

26
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:01,020
see students encountering quarter,

27
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,400
after quarter, after quarter?

28
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,040
Is there a pattern that you saw maybe early in

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,600
your career that you've helped students get

30
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,700
past through the way that you taught the course?

31
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,710
Or what challenges do you

32
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,960
see on a regular basis that students tend to run into,

33
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,180
and how do you help students get past those challenges?

34
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,060
>> Well, one issue that comes up

35
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,860
often is Logic is a very abstract subject,

36
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:32,768
and being abstract,

37
00:01:32,768 --> 00:01:37,340
some students can find it dry and dull.

38
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,000
And as a result,

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,830
they will maybe skim

40
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,420
the material because they don't find it very interesting.

41
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:54,740
And Logic has a nature that if you skim the material,

42
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:57,825
sometimes you'll think you understand it,

43
00:01:57,825 --> 00:02:01,685
and then when it comes to taking the test,

44
00:02:01,685 --> 00:02:04,490
you'll realize that you

45
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:07,700
thought you understood it but you don't understand it.

46
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:10,190
So you'll read the definitions,

47
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,300
you'll read the ideas,

48
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,765
you'll think about them briefly,

49
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,160
and then when it comes to applying them on a test,

50
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,199
you'll make a lot of mistakes.

51
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:21,920
And the mistakes indicate

52
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,040
that you didn't really grasp the ideas.

53
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,343
And what that teaches students,

54
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:30,878
and what I try to emphasize to students is that,

55
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:35,710
this is a subject that you you have to practice.

56
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,000
It's like Algebra, you can't

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,950
make it through an Algebra course without practicing.

58
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,618
You can be taught how to factor a polynomial,

59
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:45,195
but you need to factor

60
00:02:45,195 --> 00:02:48,993
10 polynomials before it really sinks in,

61
00:02:48,993 --> 00:02:50,998
before your mind really gets a grip on it.

62
00:02:50,998 --> 00:02:52,310
And Logic is like that,

63
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,990
you have to take

64
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:55,340
the abstract concepts and

65
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,320
apply them to real arguments and

66
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,950
real reasoning processes many times before they sink in.

67
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:07,635
And that's my advice to any student.

68
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,640
And there are payoffs to this,

69
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,760
there are a number of studies that have

70
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,710
shown that students who study Logic,

71
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:19,430
do better in Math.

72
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:19,818
>> True.

73
00:03:19,818 --> 00:03:24,160
>> And these are controlled studies that show

74
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:28,285
that Logic improves mathematical abilities

75
00:03:28,285 --> 00:03:30,970
and improves reasoning abilities.

76
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:35,125
And many times in the classroom,

77
00:03:35,125 --> 00:03:38,140
I have given reasoning tests

78
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,165
to students at the start of the quarter,

79
00:03:40,165 --> 00:03:44,030
and at the end of the quarter, anonymous reasoning tests.

80
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,575
And students who stick with it,

81
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:50,680
find that the study

82
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,905
of logic does improve their reasoning abilities.

83
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:56,770
And there is a lot of patterns of

84
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:00,380
reasoning that mislead us.

85
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:05,215
They look like they're good reasoning and they're not.

86
00:04:05,215 --> 00:04:07,760
And so students who haven't studied reasoning

87
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,595
carefully and don't pay attention to their reasoning,

88
00:04:10,595 --> 00:04:13,280
can get caught in these traps

89
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,945
that look like they're good reasoning when they're not.

90
00:04:15,945 --> 00:04:18,313
And in fact, this is why Aristotle,

91
00:04:18,313 --> 00:04:21,000
the founder of Logic,

92
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,605
wrote a whole book on this.

93
00:04:22,605 --> 00:04:25,790
He wrote a book called Sophistical Refutations.

94
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:29,450
And it was a study of logical fallacies

95
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,850
that are patterns of

96
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:34,940
reasoning that look good on the surface,

97
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,595
and if you don't think too hard and you're not

98
00:04:37,595 --> 00:04:41,435
self-reflective, they can fool you.

99
00:04:41,435 --> 00:04:44,068
And they're called fallacies,

100
00:04:44,068 --> 00:04:48,980
and the study of Logic can help you avoid fallacies.

101
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,580
And it can help you identify them

102
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:56,815
and spot them in other's thinking.

103
00:04:56,815 --> 00:05:00,050
Today there's a group of people

104
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:03,385
who specialize in fallacies.

105
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:05,780
They're called politicians.

106
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:08,618
I shouldn't get political here but I will say that,

107
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,740
and I'm not being partisan here,

108
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:14,610
but fallacies have long been the tool of

109
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,565
the corrupt politician who

110
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:19,700
uses faulty reasoning to sway the masses.

111
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:20,840
>> Since the time of Plato. Right?

112
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,780
>> Since the time of Socrates and Plato.

113
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,305
And Aristotle defined a tyrant

114
00:05:27,305 --> 00:05:32,670
as an individual who uses faulty logic to sway the crowd,

115
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:35,000
to give him power which he then

116
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,488
uses for his own self-interest,

117
00:05:38,488 --> 00:05:42,320
and to reduce the freedom of the people,

118
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,190
and harm the body politic.

119
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:46,280
So anyway, Logic can help you

120
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,578
reason better and there are studies that show it.

121
00:05:48,578 --> 00:05:50,627
>> And we're going to talk a little bit more about this.

122
00:05:50,627 --> 00:05:51,710
Paul and I will have

123
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,895
this conversation later on in the course.

124
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,670
We'll have another video that we'll

125
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,270
record on that very topic.

126
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,410
We'll actually work through

127
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,875
some arguments and show you some fallacious reasoning.

128
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,260
And of course the rest of the course,

129
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,490
Logic and Computational

130
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:06,740
Thinking, talks about that as well.

131
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,120
So the lesson here,

132
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,670
the recommendation is you're going to get stuck.

133
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:11,840
There's going to be parts of

134
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,700
the course where you're going to get bogged down,

135
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,260
and you might be tempted to throw

136
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,360
your hands up and say I can't get this.

137
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,470
But I think our message is, you can get this.

138
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,300
You can definitely figure this out.

139
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:24,403
I like to tell my students all the time,

140
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:26,780
there's going to be a point in the course as you're

141
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,830
studying where things are going to

142
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:29,530
start to click. You're going to see it.

143
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,235
It's going to be completely opaque and

144
00:06:31,235 --> 00:06:32,150
you're not going to be able

145
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,134
to figure out what's going on,

146
00:06:33,134 --> 00:06:34,250
and all of a sudden you'll try

147
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:35,780
a practice test or

148
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,580
you'll go through one of the exercises and you'll say,

149
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,815
"Oh, I finally get it now.

150
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,550
It makes sense to me."

151
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,250
So, I think your recommendation

152
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,840
after 35 years of teaching is persist,

153
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,870
practice, try to apply what you're

154
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,305
learning in the real world and it will come.

155
00:06:50,305 --> 00:06:51,350
You can figure it out,

156
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,375
you can get past past the hurdles.

157
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,430
So that's, I think,

158
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,390
a very important message that we both want

159
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:59,505
to give to you students is to stick with it.

160
00:06:59,505 --> 00:07:01,550
>> And sometimes it comes very fast.

161
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:01,860
>> Yes. That's right.

162
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,320
>> I've seen students,

163
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,795
on one day there's

164
00:07:05,795 --> 00:07:09,030
a certain logical process and they're stuck,

165
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:10,745
and they can't solve it,

166
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:14,615
and they can't work it, and they're frustrated.

167
00:07:14,615 --> 00:07:17,430
And I've seen them come in the very next day,

168
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,815
and it has all become clear to them.

169
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:22,690
It's just all the clouds have

170
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:26,165
parted and all of a sudden they're just a whiz.

171
00:07:26,165 --> 00:07:28,960
There's a sort of

172
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,198
a point where they see it. It's like a Eureka moment.

173
00:07:33,198 --> 00:07:34,980
>> Yes, yes correct.

174
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,925
>>And this happens all the time in Logic.

175
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:37,945
And when it happens,

176
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,463
a lot of students,

177
00:07:39,463 --> 00:07:41,590
they're so proud of themselves and so happy that they

178
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:44,595
kept pushing and then they made the breakthrough.

179
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:45,880
It's a good experience.

180
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:48,145
I see it all the time in Logic class.

181
00:07:48,145 --> 00:07:50,060
>> Yes. And it's actually

182
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,520
a great feeling when that happens.

183
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,870
When they get over that hump.

184
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,940
The other thing that I can't emphasize

185
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,295
enough you said this and I totally agree with you is,

186
00:07:57,295 --> 00:07:59,440
practice the stuff in the real world.

187
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,373
Right? If someone is trying to convince you of something,

188
00:08:01,373 --> 00:08:02,650
see if you can analyze what

189
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,480
they're trying to convince you of,

190
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,065
and the reasons that they're giving for

191
00:08:06,065 --> 00:08:08,915
trying to get you to believe that that thing is true.

192
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:11,455
That exercise, I studied

193
00:08:11,455 --> 00:08:14,733
philosophy formally in my graduate program 20 years ago,

194
00:08:14,733 --> 00:08:16,420
and I've been trying to do this ever since.

195
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:18,100
And the more you do it,

196
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,185
the better you get at doing it,

197
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:22,030
and it really actually helps you

198
00:08:22,030 --> 00:08:25,020
understand how to construct your own arguments better,

199
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,790
as well as analyze the arguments of others.

200
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,630
So practice in the real world as well as

201
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:32,380
the academic world in the exercises that we give you.

202
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,150
I want to spend a little bit of time

203
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,830
talking about success stories.

204
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:38,140
So, like we said in the first videos,

205
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,775
Logic can be a little bit academic,

206
00:08:39,775 --> 00:08:42,150
a little bit esoteric to people.

207
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,110
But we've both seen Logic actually

208
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:46,623
help people be successful,

209
00:08:46,623 --> 00:08:47,740
and where they can apply

210
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,420
the learnings that they've taken from

211
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:53,405
the classroom and show them in the real world.

212
00:08:53,405 --> 00:08:54,790
I want to read a couple of quotes here.

213
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:58,330
You sent me one, an email prior to our getting together.

214
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:01,023
This was from a student that Paul had,

215
00:09:01,023 --> 00:09:02,885
the student said, "Thank you for a great quarter.

216
00:09:02,885 --> 00:09:05,020
I had a fun time, if you can believe it,

217
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,770
a fun time learning Logic,

218
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:08,710
a subject I really knew nothing about

219
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,665
when going into the quarter. And so I learned a lot.

220
00:09:11,665 --> 00:09:12,940
I loved the abstraction of

221
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,975
Logic and its application to the real world."

222
00:09:14,975 --> 00:09:18,138
So this student apparently sees it as abstract,

223
00:09:18,138 --> 00:09:20,135
but then also very applicable.

224
00:09:20,135 --> 00:09:21,460
And then she said, "I would definitely say

225
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,230
my skill level on reasoning has improved.

226
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:25,300
Thank you for your dedication to your students,

227
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:26,680
and your evident passion for

228
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,803
the subject and teaching of the subject."

229
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:29,965
I know you've heard that a lot of-

230
00:09:29,965 --> 00:09:33,475
>> Yes. I didn't expect that to be part of this.

231
00:09:33,475 --> 00:09:37,020
I sent that to Paul yesterday or the day before.

232
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,705
It was a student this quarter.

233
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:43,960
But that's a common comment from students.

234
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,739
>> And I had a student from Angola,

235
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:48,275
Africa actually write this in

236
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:50,495
this recent quarter that I taught: "Thanks to

237
00:09:50,495 --> 00:09:52,803
Professor Paul Pardi at Microsoft for the course offered,

238
00:09:52,803 --> 00:09:54,573
the classes, the teaching material,

239
00:09:54,573 --> 00:09:55,745
and the teaching methodology.

240
00:09:55,745 --> 00:09:57,020
They were all excellent.

241
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,420
I was pleased to learn about Logic and

242
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,560
apply this methodology in

243
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,360
professional and personal life."

244
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,743
And to me, that's what it's all about.

245
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:05,440
Taking the concepts from the classroom,

246
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,875
the digital classroom or the brick and mortar classroom,

247
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:11,080
and then using those concepts in the real world.

248
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,890
That just makes it, makes it all worth it for sure.

249
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,665
Any other comments on that,

250
00:10:15,665 --> 00:10:17,290
and students that have come back

251
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:19,340
after years and saying I really use this and that?

252
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:23,470
>> Well, an older student

253
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:26,965
emailed me just the other day and she said,

254
00:10:26,965 --> 00:10:29,950
she's in the online Logic class.

255
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:35,020
And she said her son had taken Logic and he

256
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:40,555
would challenge her logically,

257
00:10:40,555 --> 00:10:42,470
and she didn't know how to answer him.

258
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,905
And she said now that she'd taken the class,

259
00:10:44,905 --> 00:10:47,446
she could answer her son

260
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:53,970
and reason with him better than she ever had before.

261
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,800
I was very pleased to hear that.

262
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,082
But in real life, once you've studied reasoning,

263
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:01,700
once you've studied Logic,

264
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,380
the study of the principles of correct reasoning.

265
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:09,100
And you were aware that there are standards of reasoning,

266
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,755
that not all reasoning is equal.

267
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:15,610
When someone is making a bad decision,

268
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,965
or presenting you with

269
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:21,783
something that you're sure is probably false,

270
00:11:21,783 --> 00:11:23,975
you can do what Socrates did.

271
00:11:23,975 --> 00:11:27,290
You can say, what is your evidence?

272
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:29,485
Why do you think that's true?

273
00:11:29,485 --> 00:11:31,665
Why do you think that's a good thing to do?

274
00:11:31,665 --> 00:11:33,990
And then you can patiently and

275
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,470
carefully help them think through their reasoning.

276
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,870
And if it is a bad decision,

277
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:42,297
you're going to find a hole,

278
00:11:42,297 --> 00:11:44,860
you're going to find a fallacy.

279
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,470
If it's a false proposition they're presenting,

280
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,433
you're going to find why it's false.

281
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:54,850
And logicians recommend that you patiently talk with

282
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,980
the person and find the hole in

283
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,540
their reasoning, find the mistake.

284
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,505
Not in an insulting way but in a charitable way,

285
00:12:04,505 --> 00:12:07,130
try to draw their attention to the problem.

286
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,810
But that's where reasoning can

287
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,265
play a big role in everyday life.

288
00:12:11,265 --> 00:12:14,785
And I would just say is,

289
00:12:14,785 --> 00:12:16,430
when I look back on my life,

290
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:18,290
I see a lot of mistakes I've made in

291
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:20,630
my life and in my thinking.

292
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:26,900
If I could go back in time I would say,

293
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,576
why are you doing that?

294
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:31,150
Why are you concluding that?

295
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,570
Think about this.

296
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,830
Think about this.

297
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,030
Most of the mistakes in

298
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:36,753
my life have been due to bad reasoning.

299
00:12:36,753 --> 00:12:36,900
>> Sure.

300
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:41,448
>> And the more you carefully reason,

301
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:43,660
the better your life choices tend to be.

302
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:46,270
That's simply a fact of experience.

303
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,270
>> And of course the premise of this course is that,

304
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,120
the reasoning that you can apply to real life not only

305
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,925
helps you in your personal relationships and problems,

306
00:12:54,925 --> 00:12:56,830
but actually helps you become a better programmer or

307
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:58,840
a better computer scientist.

308
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,690
So, you can apply the concepts both

309
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:05,155
directly to deductive and inductive reasoning,

310
00:13:05,155 --> 00:13:06,760
but also indirectly through the way

311
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,395
that you interact with other human beings.

312
00:13:09,395 --> 00:13:10,780
There's a lot of value in

313
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,015
applying yourself to this material.

314
00:13:13,015 --> 00:13:14,270
Well thanks for that, Paul.

315
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:16,510
Again, I appreciate your insights into this.

316
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,670
The many years that you've taught,

317
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:20,995
the fact that you've written four books

318
00:13:20,995 --> 00:13:23,095
on Logic and Critical Thinking,

319
00:13:23,095 --> 00:13:25,300
gives you a lot of credibility in terms of

320
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:27,820
your guidance to students.

321
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,140
So I appreciate you taking the time

322
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,030
to talk with us about these topics.

323
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,265
So again, the message is,

324
00:13:33,265 --> 00:13:35,810
apply consistent work to the coursework.

325
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,688
You can get through this and be successful.

326
00:13:38,688 --> 00:13:40,940
And our message to you is that,

327
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:44,115
if you do apply yourself and you work hard,

328
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:45,400
you will find the value in

329
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,810
this coursework even if at times it

330
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:48,145
seems a little boring or doesn't

331
00:13:48,145 --> 00:13:50,060
seem like it's going to apply to your life.

332
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,570
Do the discipline of going through the exercises,

333
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:55,755
reading the material, and you will find benefit.

334
00:13:55,755 --> 00:13:57,330
Thanks, enjoy the course.

335
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,000
>> Thank you.
