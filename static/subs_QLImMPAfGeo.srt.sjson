So what we have done is we have","really tried to create","an API offering which helps existing MongoDB customers.","And the way we do that is we basically let","customers use existing tools of MongoDB,","and use existing code of MongoDB.","And then go ahead and treat","the Cosmos DB's MongoDB API offering","as if it is a complete MongoDB API as it is.","So idea here is to","respect the tools and respect the code that they have.",">> Okay. And so with MongoDB,","is there a high level of compatibility?","I can lift the shift meaning maybe","mean stack applications?",">> Yes. Actually, you asked a very right question.","So we do have that capability.","Most of our customers literally transfer","the data onto the site and while changing the code,","the chains of connection string","and let the full code work as it is.","So it is not just restricted to mean application,","but pretty much all the applications who require","any kind of connectivity back to the database,","in this case the MongoDB,","they just change the connection string and","majority of the things work out of the box as it is.",">> Oh, wow. And so, yeah.","I have a lot of Mongo tools I use right now.","So, for example, I like to use the Azure cloud console,","so things like the Mongo shell.","Does those tools work with the MongoDB API?",">> Oh, yes. Definitely. So tools like Mongo shell, right?","Tools like the dumpen Mongo's tool,","right? The Mongo list tool.","So pretty much everything that you can think","of or overshared for another set of tools too.","They work as it is.","The magic here is that we are actually wire compatible.","So, that is the key part.","So what that means is there is a protocol with","which the clients talk to","the server and we have taken","that wire protocol and we are","compatible with that wire protocol every time.",">> That sounds really exciting and someone","who does some development using","MongoDB today to be able to just go into","Cosmos DB as is and then use my application.","I'm just very excited to dig","further into MongoDPA and API,","and how we could use it with Cosmos DB.",">> Sure. Definitely, we can help you with that."]}
