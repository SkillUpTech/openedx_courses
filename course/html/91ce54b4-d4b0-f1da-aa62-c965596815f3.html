<p>When you first read that definition, you might see two components. But there actually are three and the third component is the most important. Let's look at each part more closely.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Premises</strong>: the reasons or evidence cited</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion</strong>: the statement being proved by the premises</li>
<li><strong>A logical relation</strong>: the logical connection from the premises to the conclusion</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that when you give an argument, the recipient of that argument should hear your premises and from the premises <em>draw</em> the conclusion. That is, the premises should cause the hearer to agree that your conclusion is true. That is why the logical relation is so important. Consider the following example:</p>
<p>Premise 1: Satya Nadella is the CEO of Microsoft<br />
Premise 2: The grass is the color green<br />
Conclusion: Therefore the sun will rise in the morning</p>
<p>Notice this appears to have the structure of an argument--we have two premises and a conclusion. However the premises in no way support the conclusion. They give us no reason to believe that the conclusion is true, even if we agreed that the premises were true.</p>
<p>Now consider this example:</p>
<p>Premise 1: All vegetables are plants<br />
Premise 2: This tomato is a vegetable<br />
Conclusion: Therefore this tomato is a plant</p>
<p>If you at least <em>assume</em> the two premises are true, then you can't help but agree with the conclusion. The conclusion is true based on the truth of the premises. This is a argument that fulfills the definition above. We have premises, a conclusion, and most importantly, a logical relationship between them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You might ask, &quot;What if I don't agree with the truth of the premises?&quot; That's a good question and we'll talk about truth later in the course. But for now, we can add the qualifier, &quot;assuming the premises are true&quot; then the conclusion follows. When testing for a logical relation, you can assume the truth of the premises to see if the conclusion follows from them. But more on that later.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the next lesson, we'll get a bit more technical and look at what makes up the premises and conclusion.</p>
