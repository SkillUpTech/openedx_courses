<p>One of the first things you notice when reading Plato’s dialogues is that Socrates asks his interlocutors lots of questions. However, his were not your usual questions. Socrates is out to help others discover their own ignorance as the first step to becoming the best persons they can be. To this end, he asks questions that will cause others to take a look in the mirror and critically evaluate their own assumptions, beliefs, values, and actions, and on the basis of independent, realistic criteria that have been found to be reliable guides to truth. Whether the individual is rich or poor,famous or unknown, of high or low class, the goal of Socratic questioning is always the same: that through self- examination, the individual will discover for himself or herself which of his or her own beliefs are true and which are not, which of his or her own actions are truly moral and which are unjust, and whether or not his or her own life is the best it can be.</p>
<p>Another thing that stands out, when reading Plato’s dialogues, is that his Socrates always engages people in conversation one-on-one. With a single exception (when he addresses a jury of his peers at the end of his life), his focus is always on the individual, never on the crowd.</p>
<p>This emphasis on <em>self</em>-examination explains why Socrates always expected honesty on the part of his interlocutors. If the other person is not answering honestly, then he or she won’t be led to examine his own beliefs and values. &quot;Say what you really believe,&quot; he would sometimes tell those he was questioning. &quot;Don’t play games with me!&quot; For Socrates, honest self-examination was one of life’s most important tasks.</p>
<p>Sincere responses were also a requirement because if the interlocutor’s answers were not sincere, then the aim of the discussion would not be the unvarnished truth. At one point in a conversation recorded in Plato’s Gorgias, Socrates says to his friend, &quot;Callicles, you’ll ruin our previous arguments and will no longer be examining the truth with me if you speak contrary to what you believe.&quot; (Plato’s <em>Gorgias</em>, 495) Moments later,Socrates has to remind him:</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">By the god of friendship, Callicles, you mustn’t think that you may play with  me and say whatever comes into your head, contrary to your real opinion, nor, conversely, must you think of me as jesting. For you see what our discussions are all about—and is there [nothing] more serious than this: what is the way we ought to <i>live</i>? (Plato's <i>Gorgias</i>, 500 b-c)</p>
<p>Socrates questioned people especially hard when he thought they were in the grips of an illusion and needed a wake-up call. Why did he bother? The answer is that he believed in the value, dignity, and freedom of the individual. But this respect for the dignity of the individual also meant that if people who are deluded are going to wake up and become real, they will ultimately have to do it themselves—it cannot be done to them or for them.</p>
<p>At the same time, Socrates also saw that many people will never even <em>start</em> the process of honest self-examination by themselves: they need outside intervention. Just as an addict usually cannot quit all by himself, most people cannot shed their illusions all by themselves, either because they are unaware of their own ignorance, or because they don’t care, or because they are so emotionally invested in their illusions that giving them up is too painful.</p>
<p>So, Socrates concluded, people mired in illusion and self-deception need a nudge. In particular, they need someone who will question them until they look in the mirror and come to see for themselves their own ignorance and shortcomings. Critical thinking, as Socrates practiced it, was as much a form of therapy as it was a search for truth. This is ultimately why Socrates carried on his philosophical mission by means of one-on-one conversation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Socratic Suggestion</strong>: On important issues, ask yourself the questions Socratic would ask: Are my assumptions on this matter really true? Or am I deluded? What does the evidence say? Are my actions morally right? Or am I only fooling myself? When others make questionable claims or propose questionable courses of action, ask them the same Socratic questions.</p>
