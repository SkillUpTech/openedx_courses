<p>So far we've looked at the modus ponens and modus tollens. Both use conditional statements in the first premise. Next we'll look at an argument form that uses conditional statements in both premises and the conclusion.</p>
<h2 id="hypothetical-syllogism">Hypothetical Syllogism</h2>
<p>In this argument, a logical connection is made between the consequent of one conditional and antecedent of another. It also introduces a third term so in this argument we'll use 'p', 'q' and 'r' for our variables. Here's the form:</p>
<ol>
<li>If p then q (p --&gt; q)</li>
<li>If q then r (q --&gt; r)</li>
<li>Therefore, if p then r (p --&gt; r)</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument tells us that if the antecedent of premise 1 is true then the consequent also must be true. And if we use that consequent as an antecedent in another conditional then the consequent of that second conditional also must be true. This allows us to affirm that if the antecedent of the first premise is true, the consequent of the second premise must also be true. Here's an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>If she is as light as a duck, then she is made of wood</li>
<li>If she is made of wood, then she will float in water</li>
<li>Therefore, if she is as light as a duck, then she will float in water.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's the necessary relationship between the antecedent and consequent of conditional statements that makes this argument work.</p>
<h2 id="disjunctive-syllogism">Disjunctive Syllogism</h2>
<p>The disjunctive syllogism is the last argument we'll look at in this course but be aware that there are many other forms you can study. We chose these four because they give you a solid framework for constructing logical arguments and have strong tie-in to logical constructions you will make in computer science.</p>
<p>The disjunctive syllogism is very simple. It takes the form of asserting a disjunction: either one thing is true or the other is. The second premise then denies that one thing is true and concludes that the other must be true. Here's the form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Either p or q (p v q)</li>
<li>It is not the case that p (~p)</li>
<li>Therefore q</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that in the second premise you can deny either disjunct. So we could have said in premise 2, it is not the case that q (~q). Just make sure that whatever disjunct you deny in premise 2, you affirm the other disjunct in the conclusion. Here's an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>Either the Beatles are playing tonight or the Rolling Stones are playing</li>
<li>It is not the case that the Beatles are playing</li>
<li>Therefore, the Rolling Stones are playing</li>
</ol>
<p>Premise 1 of this argument states that either one or the other <em>must be</em> true. In real life, we tend to think of myriad possibilities for a given situation and its rare that we only one of two options must be true. But that's what the disjunctive syllogism states. This is sometimes referred to as &quot;an exhaustive dilemma&quot; which means the two options (<em>di</em> meaning two and <em>lemma</em> meaning premise or proposition) are exhaustive-- or they cover all possibilities.</p>
