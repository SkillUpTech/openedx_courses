<p>We've covered the structure of arguments and the make up of the individual components that make them up. Studying just the structure of an argument can get you pretty far but to evaluate an argument fully, you have to know whether its premises and conclusion are <em>true.</em> Logicians call this the propositions <em>truth value</em>.</p>
<p>In logic, a proposition can only be true or false. It can't be neither and it can't be both. When you don't know a proposition's truth value, you can, for the sake of analysis, assume it's true.</p>
<p>Many propositions can be true at one time and false at another and some are always true and always false. For example:</p>
<ol>
<li>A square is a circle</li>
<li>Mount Fuji is located on Honshu Island in Japan</li>
<li>It is raining in Seattle</li>
</ol>
<p>Proposition number 1 is always false and number 2 is always true. These are not dependent on any other condition and do not change. Proposition 3 can be true at one point in time and false at another (and during certain seasons, change from minute to minute!). So in order to clarify the proposition, we might have to specify the time. So we might need to rephrase proposition 3 as, &quot;It rained in Seattle on May 5, 2017&quot;. Now we determine whether it did in fact rain in Seattle at that time and assign it the proper truth value.</p>
<p>But we can assign 3 a truth value as it is written even if we're not sure. We can assign it a value of true <em>for the sake of argument</em> and see how it works in an argument.</p>
