<p>Aristotle discovered that every categorical sentence has a <em>quantity</em> and a <em>quality</em>. The quantity is <em>universal</em> if the sentence makes a claim about every member of the subject
term category, and the quantity is <em>particular</em> if the sentence makes a claim about some members of the category denoted by the subject term.</p>
<p>Thus, a sentence such as, &quot;All snakes are reptiles&quot; is a universal sentence because it makes a claim about <em>every</em> member of the subject category. But a sentence such as, &quot;No birds are mammals&quot; is also universal, for it, too, makes a claim about every member of its subject category, namely, that every bird is not a mammal. In contrast, statements such as &quot;Some cats are pets&quot; and &quot;Some cats are not pets&quot; are obviously particular because they talk about some of the subject category.</p>
<p>The quality is affirmative if the copula affirms membership in the predicate category, and the quality is negative if it denies membership in the predicate group. For example, &quot;All aardvarks are mammals&quot; is affirmative, because the copula tells us the members of the subject category are included within the predicate category. &quot;Some cats are pets&quot; is also affirmative,
for it, too, says members of the subject group belong to the predicate group.</p>
<p>However, the sentence &quot;Some cats are not pets&quot; is negative, since the copula denies membership in the predicate category (“Some cats do not belong to the pet category”).</p>
<p>Thus:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Sentences of the form &quot;All S are P&quot; are both universal and affirmative. They are therefore <strong>universal affirmative sentences</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sentences of the form &quot;No S are P&quot; are both universal and negative. These are <strong>universal negative sentences</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sentences of the form &quot;Some S are P&quot; are both particular and affirmative. These are <strong>particular affirmative sentences</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Sentences of the form &quot;Some S are not P&quot; are both particular and negative. These are <strong>particular negative sentences</strong>.</p>
</li>
