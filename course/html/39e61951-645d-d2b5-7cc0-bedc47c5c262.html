<p>In this topic, we'll walk through the process of creating a Venn Diagram for a valid argument to show how it works. Let’s begin with the Barbara (AAA-Figure 1) syllogism:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>All mammals are warm-blooded creatures.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All aardvarks are mammals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Therefore, all aardvarks are warm-blooded creatures.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our first step is to abbreviate the argument, placing the conclusion at the bottom:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>All M are W.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All A are M.</p>
</li>
<li><p>All A are W.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Second, we draw the three overlapping circles. For step 3 we label the circles:</p>

<p>The subject term of the conclusion, A, is at the lower left. The predicate term of the conclusion, W, is at the lower right. The middle term, M, is above and to the middle.</p>
<p>Because both premises are universal, we can enter them into the diagram in either order. We’ll adopt the Aristotelian assumption in this example. The major premise tells us that all M are W. That is, no M are not W. In terms of the diagram, this indicates that all of the M circle that is outside the W circle is empty. Therefore, the part of the M circle that is outside the W circle must be shaded to indicate that it is empty.</p>

<p>Next, we enter into the diagram the information from the other premise, “All A are M.” This premise asserts that all aardvarks belong to the class of mammals. That is, all of the members of the A circle are inside the M circle. To enter this information, we must shade the part of the A circle that lies outside the M circle, indicating that this area is empty.</p>

<p>The preceding diagram represents the information contained in the premises. We purposely do not enter the information from the conclusion. Finally, we inspect the diagram to see if the information in the conclusion is already represented in the diagram of the premises. If it is, then the conclusion cannot possibly be false if the premises are true, which means the argument is valid. The conclusion “All A are W” indicates that all members of the class of A are also members of the class of W. That is, nothing in the A circle is not also in the W circle. And that is, indeed, exactly what our diagram indicates, for all sections of the A circle outside the W circle have been shaded. Nothing more would need to be added to our diagram to have it also represent the conclusion. The information content of the conclusion is already present in the premises. The conclusion would have to be true if the premises are true. <strong>The argument is therefore valid</strong>.</p>
