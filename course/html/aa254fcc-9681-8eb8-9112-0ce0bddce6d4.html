<h3 id="logic-an-brief-introduction">Logic: A Brief Introduction</h3>
<p>This course will teach you the fundamentals of formal logic and show you how logical thinking and logical concepts were applied to design and build digital machines. By gaining skills in logical analysis, you will not only gain important life skills, but you'll better understand how computers work which will make you a better technician in the long run.</p>
<p>As we'll see more later, logic is a science that sets forth rules for properly-ordered thinking while critical thinking mainly is the application of those rules. Many introductory students tend to think that logic is <em>imposed</em> on human thinking. It's better to think of logic as something philosophers and mathematicians have <em>discovered about</em> human thinking. So logical rules are like laws of nature: they were formed <em>out of years of observation</em> on how thinking works when it's working well.</p>
<h3 id="the-wheres-and-whys-of-logic-and-critical-thinking">The Wheres and Whys of Logic and Critical Thinking</h3>
<p>Although nobody has discovered a handy formula that sums it all up, many individuals down through the centuries have thought deeply about thinking, and a number of standards, or criteria, have been proposed, tested, and found to be reliable guides to sound judgment and the attainment of truth, or correspondence with reality. For an example of such a criterion, consider statistical thinking. To learn about a large population of things, we sometimes examine a sample and then conclude something about the population as a whole on the basis of what we observe in the sample. It is common sense that the larger the sample, in relation to the whole population, the more likely the conclusion is to be true. It is also common sense that the more randomly selected the sample, the more likely the conclusion is to be true.</p>
<p>Thus, critical thinking is more than mere <em>criterial</em> thinking. Rather, it is thinking on the basis of criteria that have been tested and found to be reliable guides to sound judgment and the attainment of the truth about the matter under consideration. Someone who makes every important decision on the basis of &quot;throwing the bones&quot; is engaged in criterial thinking: throwing the bones is this person’s <em>criterion</em>. (Throwing the bones is an ancient form of divination in which animal bones are tossed onto a mat and the pattern is interpreted, usually by a shaman, spiritual reader, or fortune-teller of some sort.) However, such a person is not a critical thinker -- at least as the words <em>critical thinker</em> are used today -- for his or her criterion has not been tested and found to be a generally reliable guide to truth and sound judgment.</p>

<p>As you work through the course, you may find yourself asking, &quot;I thought this was a computer science course so why am I learning all this logic that has nothing to do with computers?&quot; If you've seen the 1984 movie <em>The Karate Kid</em>, you may remember that young Daniel asked Mr. Miyagi to teach him Karate. On the first few days Daniel showed up for training Mr. Miyagi &quot;assigned&quot; Daniel a bunch of chores around Miyagi's house like painting his fence, sanding his deck, and waxing his cars. After three days of back-breaking work, Daniel lashes out in rage at Mr. Miyagi complaining that he hasn't learned any Karate. Mr. Miyagi replies, &quot;You learn plenty.&quot; Daniel retorts, &quot;I learn plenty, yeah, I learned how to sand your decks maybe. I washed your car, paint your house, paint your fence. I learn plenty!&quot; Patiently Mr. Miyagi teaches Daniel, &quot;Ah, not everything is as it seems. . .&quot; and then shows Daniel how the muscle memory he was building from doing the chores <em>had</em> to be learned first before he could actually develop the skills to do Karate properly.</p>
<p>While many of the lessons, exercises, and assessments will not seem to directly relate to computer programming or computer science, you will be learning something important: how to think logically. You will be developing very important muscles that will serve you immensely when you learn how to program. If you already program, the skills you learn in this course will help you become a better programmer.</p>
<p>So be patient and work carefully through the lessons. When you've mastered the content, your mind will have gained important skills that you can not only apply to work you do in computer science but will serve you in all of your life.</p>

<p>One of the primary ideas this course will explore is the relationship between logical and critical thinking and computer science. In order to establish that relationship, let's first take a look at how computers work and then we'll dive into basic principles of formal logic.</p>
