<p>In the last lesson we saw that an argument is made up of premises, a conclusion, and a logical relation. We now need to look more closely at the premises and conclusion to see what types of things they are. For example, can we use any sentence as a premise? The answer is no, we can't! The premises and conclusion are very specific types of sentences.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While our examples in this course are in English, the principles apply to any language that makes declarative claims. We'll see why this is so shortly.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we write (or speak) premises and conclusions, we are writing what are called <strong>declarative statements</strong> or just <strong>statements</strong>. Put simply, <em>a statement is a language-based sentence that expresses a truth or possible truth</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>All US citizens live in the US</li>
<li>Most businesses in Seattle use red carpeting in their offices</li>
<li>Apple has a higher market capitalization than Microsoft</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that each of these statements attempt to declare a truth. Of course, the first two sentences are false and the third (as of this writing) is true. But for the purposes of logic, each qualifies as a statement because it is declaring something that may possibly be true. In the English language, these are called &quot;declaratives.&quot; Only declaratives qualify as statements in logic. Here are various types of speech acts so you can compare and contrast them all.</p>
<ol>
<li>Questions or interrogative: &quot;What time is it?&quot;</li>
<li>Commands or imperative: &quot;Close the door!&quot;</li>
<li>Exclamations or exclamatory: &quot;Ouch!&quot;</li>
<li>Performatives: &quot;I promise&quot; or &quot;I thee wed&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Declaratives</strong>: &quot;Carbon is an element&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>Only declaratives qualify as statements because these are the only types of sentences that make a claim that something is true and this is what is important in logic.</p>
