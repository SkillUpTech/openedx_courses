<p>In the last lesson, we saw that premises and conclusions are made up of statements--declartive sentences that make claim that something is possibly true.</p>
<h2 id="simple-and-compound-statements">Simple and Compound Statements</h2>
<p>A statement that declares a single truth is called a <strong>simple statement</strong>. In English, these are grammatically simple too. They typically have a subject, verb, and object:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ann is home</li>
<li>Bob is home</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see that each of these sentences declare that something is true and that only one situation or state of affairs is true. When writing logical arguments, it's good practice to break down your premises into simple statements as much as you can. This makes determining with the truth of the statements in your argument easier.</p>
<p>But what if you want to declare more than one truth in your premise? In this case you can join two or more simple statements using a <strong>statement operator</strong>. A statement operator connects simple statements to form a <strong>compound statement</strong>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ann is home AND Bob is home</li>
<li>The screen door has a hole in it OR I'm seeing things</li>
</ul>
<p>In each sentence above, we have two simple statements joined by AND and OR and these operators allow us to declare more than one truth using simple statements. We'll learn a set of operators in a later lesson and you'll see why using operators is important when you start to construct your own arguments.</p>
<h2 id="something-is-missing">Something is Missing</h2>
<p>At this point, you may notice that something is missing. If you've ever tried to convince someone of something using an argument, you may notice that the argument may not work. The other person may not understand what you're saying or you may use the &quot;wrong&quot; word. You get bogged down in <em>semantics</em> rather than focusing on the logic of the argument.</p>
<p>Suppose I said,</p>
<p><code>&quot;The epistemic position of the defense side of the litigation lacks justificatory veracity.&quot;</code></p>
<p>This is a declarative statement but it may not be fully understood by the person hearing the claim. I could simplify this statement as,</p>
<p><code>&quot;The defendant failed to make her case.&quot;</code></p>
<p>This is easier to understand but it appears to be a different statement than the first one I made. Which one should I use in my argument? Can they be used interchangeably without modifying the logical force of the argument? It is this topic that we'll take up in the next lesson.</p>
