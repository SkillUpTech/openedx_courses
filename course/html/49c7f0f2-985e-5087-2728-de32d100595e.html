<p>The negation operator is the only monadic operator and it negates the truth value of the simple statement that follows it. So if the simple statement is true, putting a negation symbol in front of it makes the compound statement false. If the simple statement is false, putting a negation in front of it makes the compound statement true.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The negation operator performs the operation of a Turing Machine we saw earlier in the module. Here's another example where computer science and truth-functional logic overlap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Symbol</strong>: ~</p>
<p><strong>Symbol Name</strong>: tilde</p>
<p><strong>Parts of negation</strong>: A simple statement with a tilde preceding it</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: Let's suppose we have the simple statement &quot;Ann is home&quot; and we symbolize that simple statement with the variable &quot;A&quot;. Using negation with that simple statement would be:</p>
<p>~A or <strong>It is not the case that</strong> Ann is home</p>
<p>The wording used here is very important. In common English, if we wanted to negate the statement &quot;Ann is home&quot; we would say &quot;Ann is <strong>not home</strong>&quot; But notice when we do that, we change the simple statement. In order to keep the simple statement consistent, we want to keep the operator distinct from the statement which it operates on. This is why we say, &quot;it is not the case that&quot; and then we state the simple statement. Now A always refers to &quot;Ann is home&quot; and the negation operator is denoted by &quot;it is not the case that&quot; or ~A.</p>
