<p>In the previous lesson we saw how a simple digital language of 0 and 1 provides the foundation for a type of language that we can use to do work. In this lesson, we'll explore how that simple language was expanded to create the foundation for the computers we use today.</p>
<p>The basic Turing machine uses 0 and 1 to create a simple "on" and "off" model. In computer science, this is called a "binary" model. The word "binary" comes from the Latin word, "binarius" which means two together or a pair. So 0 and 1 are a pair of digits or a "binary digit." This phrase was shortened to the word "bit." A bit in computer science then is the two states 0 and 1 and the basic unit of the binary system computers use. Like a light switch, a bit can only be either 0 or 1 at any given time but has the potential to be either at a given time.</p>
<p>Computer systems then are built from this simple model of bits in combination with other bits. In the last lesson we considered two light switches that, when combined in different states, produces different colored lights:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Switch 1</th><th>Switch 2</th><th>Color</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Off</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Red</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In the language of bits, this a two bit system. We have two binary states that work together to form four different combinations producing a lights off state and three different colored lights on states. Modern computers use eight bits in combination to form the fundamental unit of digital information. This unit is called a <strong>byte</strong>.</p>
<p>In the very first modern computers a byte with its bits in various combinations was used to represent a single character of text. The table below shows the byte representation of the letter "A" in binary language:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th>Bit 1</th><th>Bit 2</th><th>Bit 3</th><th>Bit 4</th><th>Bit 5</th><th>Bit 6</th><th>Bit 7</th><th>Bit 8</th><th>Letter</th></tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When a user presses the letter A on her computer, the keyboard sends a signal to the processor of the computer that translates the signal into the byte representation above. When the CPU (central processsing unit -- the "brains" of the computer") gets that digital combination, it knows that it needs to send another signal to the screen to draw the letter "A". All modern computers at their core use a similar model to create the complex operations that you enjoy on your phone, tablet, or desktop computer.</p>
