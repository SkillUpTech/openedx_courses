<p>If you're new to edX, here is some information to get you started. Even if you've used edX for other courses, the information here will help you understand how this course is organized.</p>
<p>This course is structured into modules, sections, and units. Each module contains a combination of written documentation (reference documents) and lab activities that cover the topic areas for that module. In this course, there are more lab sections than there are documentation sections, so you will be spending more time working through the hands-on activities than reading about the technologies. Each module contains all of the material that you'll need to learn the included topics, and we've included links to additional sources of information if you are interested in digging even deeper into the technologies.</p>
<p>To navigate through the sections of a module, use the navigation bar at the top of the display window. You can use the left and right arrows to move back-and-forth through the units, and you can hover your mouse pointer over unit icon to see the unit title.</p>
<p>As noted above, each module in this course will have some combination of reading material, labs, and video content. The modules and the labs are meant to be taken in order, but you can skip around in the resource document sections, or even skip over a topic if you have already mastered the material in a particular unit. In order to get the most out of the lab assignments, you should make sure that you understand the material in the resource documents.</p>
<h4 id="instructor-feedback">INSTRUCTOR FEEDBACK</h4>
<p>Given the nature of this MOOC-style course and the large number of students enrolled, it's not possible for instructors to provide feedback to every comment or question from students. However, we encourage you to use the discussion boards to seek help and use our new <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13556127" title="" target="_blank">LinkedIn Group</a> to get feedback from the instructor and your peers. This is a great way to help each other and enrich your learning experience.</p>
<h4 id="peer-discussion">PEER DISCUSSION</h4>
<p>While you can use the edX discussion forum to converse with fellow students, we encourage you to use the <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13556127" title="" target="_blank">LinkedIn Group</a> for this course as it offers more flexibiliy and functionality. It also allows you to stay connected with your fellow students after the course is over and connect with students from other sections of the course as they're offered.
