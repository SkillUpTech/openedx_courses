<p>Science operates on forming hypotheses and then spending time confirming or disconfirming those hypotheses. In this section we're going to take a look at a methodology--something you can apply to the problems you need to solve--that use inductive reasoning to form and confirm hypotheses. Applying the principles in this section can help you become a better engineer and even help you solve problems in life in general.</p>
<h2 id="the-hypothetico-deductive-method">The Hypothetico-Deductive Method</h2>
<p>The method used to test an individual hypothesis in science is sometimes called the <strong>hypothetico-deductive method</strong> since it involves hypotheses and predictions deduced from them. The method is often presented in the following idealized steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Scientists encounter a puzzling phenomenon that needs an explanation.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Scientists propose a hypothesis that would, if true, explain the phenomenon.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Scientists ask, If the hypothesis is true, what facts about the world can we expect to observe or otherwise detect with our senses? To answer this question, they derive
<strong>observational predictions</strong> from the hypothesis.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Scientists test the hypothesis by observing the world to see if the phenomenon predicted will be observed.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>. Finally, they accept, reject, or revise the hypothesis on the basis of the test observations.</p>
<h2 id="formulating-a-hypothesis">Formulating a Hypothesis</h2>
<p>Some people suppose that a hypothesis is derived straight from the data collected via a process of enumerative induction. Although this is sometimes the case, in most cases the hypothesis is “thought up” via a creative, imaginative process that is more like painting a picture than like completing a list (enumeration) of observations. Formulating an explanatory hypothesis after puzzling over the facts is a creative process requiring guesswork, inspiration, and imagination, combined with a basic knowledge of how the world works. No hard-and-fast rules tell the scientist how to come up with a good hypothesis.</p>
<h2 id="deriving-predictions">Deriving Predictions</h2>
<p>In order for a hypothesis to count as scientific, it must be empirical in character. This rule has been part of the scientific enterprise since the beginnings of modern science in the sixteenth century. An empirical hypothesis is one that generates observational predictions—predictions that can be verified on the basis of observable facts (i.e., facts that can be detected using our physical senses). When scientists derive predictions from an empirical hypothesis, either deductive or inductive reasoning may be employed. Thus, deduction and induction are both used in science to derive predictions from hypotheses.</p>
<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>
<p>The fact that some scientific hypotheses are literally “dreamed up” does not mean that scientists invent their own truths. The fact that a hypothesis has been put forward does not mean that it is true. Regardless of how a hypothesis was initially thought up, once it is presented to the scientific community, it must “run the gantlet.” The gantlet, of course, will be a series of standard scientific tests. A hypothesis will not be considered true until it has passed the standard tests. In addition, the tests will be performed by many researchers from various locations, and many of these researchers will have no vested interest in the hypothesis being found true. Indeed, some may actively try to disprove the hypothesis.</p>
<p>One important requirement at this stage of the investigation is reproducibility. The results of a test must be reproducible by any scientist anywhere, as long as the specified procedures are followed. There is never any guarantee that a hypothesis, once formed, will prove true.</p>
