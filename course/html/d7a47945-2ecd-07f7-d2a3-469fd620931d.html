<p>In an earlier lesson, we learned about deductive validity. Validity is important but its only one part of constructing a good deductive argument. Being in the right form is essential but we also want true premises. When our arguments are in a valid form <em>and</em> have true premises, we say our argument is <strong>sound</strong>. Constructing sounds arguments should always be your goal.</p>
<p>Let's take this argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>All crayons are colored</li>
<li>All colored things are pigmented things</li>
<li>Therefore, all crayons are pigmented things</li>
</ol>
<p>This argument is a valid form (you can tell because it's not possible that the premises are true but the conclusion false) and the premises are true so we have a sound argument.</p>
<p>Some other things to remember about soundness:</p>
<ul>
<li>All invalid arguments are unsound</li>
<li>It's possible for an argument to be valid but unsound but not invalid and sound</li>
<li>You can't determine soundness from the structure alone or with a argument that contains only symbols (though you can determine validity). This is because soundness depends on truth value and you can only know whether a premise is true if the premise has <em>propositional content</em> or meaning.</li>
</ul>
