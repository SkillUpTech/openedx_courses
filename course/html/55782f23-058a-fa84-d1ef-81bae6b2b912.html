<p>Learning to use truth tables can help you better understand how compound statements are structured and help you determine the truth value of compound statements that use many operators.</p>
<p>To practice truth tables, go back to the lessons on operators (negation, conjunction, disjunction, and conditionals) and create your own truth tables for the examples shown in each of those lessons. Share your tables with your fellow students in the discussion forums and get some feedback!</p>
<p>To get you started, here is the first line of the truth table for negation. Can you fill in the rest and create truth tables for the other examples in the operators lessons?</p>
<p>Statement: Ann is Home symbolized as A
Statement with negation ~A</p>
<p>Truth Table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>A</th>
<th></th>
<th>~</th>
<th>A</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td></td>
<td><em>F</em></td>
<td>T</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
