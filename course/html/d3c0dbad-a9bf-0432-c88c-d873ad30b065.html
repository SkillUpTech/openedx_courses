<p>You've been learning in this course that part of the goal of logic is to take arguments from everyday grammar and shape it into logical form so it's easier to analyze. For example if someone said to you:</p>
<p>&quot;You'll wait in traffic longer by going that way.&quot;</p>
<p>You can restate this as a compound statement, a conditional:</p>
<p>&quot;If you go that way then you'll wait in traffic longer.&quot;</p>
<p>Each sentence means the same thing but by restating the sentence as a conditional, you can now place it into one of our standard forms and use it in an argument. Statements in categorical logic have a standard form as well and we'll look at that briefly.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form">Standard Form</h2>
<p>The subject and predicate terms of a standard categorical statement must each be a noun that denotes a class or category of things. Thus, the sentence “Some roses are red” is not in standard form, since its predicate term is an adjective (red), and adjectives do not by themselves name groups of things (they denote characteristics of things). In everyday life, we often state categorical sentences that have adjectives as their predicate terms, but this is easy to fix. If the predicate term is only an adjective, we can change the adjective to a noun or a noun-like expression referring to a class or category of things. For example, if we rewrite “Some roses are red” as “Some roses are red flowers,” then the sentence fits the standard form, for red flowers names a class of things. In general, then, if a statement has an adjectival predicate, replace this predicate with a term naming the class of all objects of
which the adjective may truly be predicated. Study the following examples closely:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Nonstandard</th>
<th></th>
<th>Standard</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>All tigers are carnivorous.</td>
<td></td>
<td>All tigers are carnivorous animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All deer are fleeing the fire.</td>
<td></td>
<td>All deer are things that are fleeing the fire.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All students are striking.</td>
<td></td>
<td>All students are persons who are striking.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h3 id="quantifiers">Quantifiers</h3>
<p>Sometimes we have to restate a sentence to include a quantifier. This can be tricky because the quantifier may be implied but it's not always clear which one to use. To
decide, think about what the author probably intends, and then add the quantifier the author probably intended. Take a look at these comparisons:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Nonstandard</th>
<th></th>
<th>Standard</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>A tiger is a mammal.</td>
<td></td>
<td>All tigers are mammals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A fish is not a mammal.</td>
<td></td>
<td>No fish are mammals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Emeralds are green.</td>
<td></td>
<td>All emeralds are green things.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A whale is a beautiful creature.</td>
<td></td>
<td>All whales are beautiful creatures.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The &quot;some&quot; quantifier can be even trickier because there are many words people use to denote &quot;at least one.&quot; As a rule, any quantity less than <em>all</em> is best translated as <em>some</em>:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Nonstandard Quantifier</th>
<th></th>
<th>Standard Interpretation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Most cats are cute.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Some cats are cute animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Few aardvarks are handsome.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Some aardvarks are handsome animals.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>At least one platypus is cute.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Some platypuses are cute animals.</td>

<td></td>
<td>Some pigs are smart animals.</td>

<td></td>
<td>Some bears are timid animals.</td>

<tr>
<td>There are bears in the woods.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Some bears are animals in the woods.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A tiger roared.</td>
<td></td>
<td>Some tigers are animals that roared.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<h3 id="copulas">Copulas</h3>
<p>The copula connects (couples) the subject and predicate terms. In standard form, the only copulas allowed are the words are and are not. Consider the sentence “All mice eat cheese.” This sentence obviously is meant to express a universal affirmative statement. However, the sentence does not contain are or are not. To place this sentence into standard form, we rewrite the predicate term so as to reserve the meaning of the original sentence while at the same time using the copula are: &quot;All mice are cheese-eaters.&quot; In other words, all mice belong to the category of cheese-eating creatures. For another example, &quot;All hens lay
eggs&quot; is not in standard form since it lacks a proper copula. Adding the copula are and making suitable adjustments produces: &quot;All hens <em>are</em> egg-laying animals.&quot;</p>
