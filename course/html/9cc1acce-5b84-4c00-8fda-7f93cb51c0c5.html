<p>If the predicted phenomenon is observed, we say that the test &quot;confirms the hypothesis.&quot; If the predicted phenomenon is not observed, we say the test &quot;disconfirms the hypothesis.&quot; These two procedures, the <strong>process of confirmation</strong> and the <strong>process of disconfirmation</strong>, lie at the heart of the scientific method. The logic of confirmation takes the following form:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the hypothesis is true, then P should be observed.</li>
<li>P is observed.</li>
<li>Therefore the hypothesis is probably true.</li>
</ol>
<p>The logic of disconfirmation takes the following form:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the hypothesis is true, then P should be observed.</li>
<li>P is not observed.</li>
<li>Therefore, the hypothesis is probably not true.</li>
</ol>
<p>The more times a hypothesis has been confirmed, the higher the probability it is true. Thus, confirmation is never an all-or-nothing affair, and a hypothesis is never guaranteed to be true. Confirmation is always a matter of degree. Likewise, the more times a hypothesis has been disconfirmed, the more likely it is false. The evidence makes it probable to some degree that the hypothesis is false. (For a real-world example of this process at work, consult Dr. Herrick's book, Chapter 11).</p>
<h2 id="comparing-rival-hypotheses">Comparing Rival Hypotheses</h2>
<p>The hypothetico-deductive method is not the totality of the scientific method. It is an idealized process for testing one individual hypothesis, or for testing hypotheses one at a time. In most test situations, many different hypotheses will have been proposed to explain a given phenomenon, and each will have some explanatory power. Scientists will have to decide which of the rival hypotheses is the overall best explanation (and thus most likely to be true). How do scientists decide between competing hypotheses of a given phenomenon? They rely on the eight criteria for inference to the best explanation that we examined in the preceding chapter—essentially the same criteria we use in everyday life when we rank competing explanations, albeit with a few refinements. Einstein was right: science is indeed just a “refinement of everyday thinking”—a refinement of inference to the best explanation. In the preceding chapter we examined these criteria for selecting the best explanation:</p>
<ol>
<li>internal consistency</li>
<li>external consistency</li>
<li>testability</li>
<li>explanatory scope</li>
<li>explanatory power</li>
<li>simplicity</li>
<li>fruitfulness</li>
<li>conservatism</li>
</ol>
