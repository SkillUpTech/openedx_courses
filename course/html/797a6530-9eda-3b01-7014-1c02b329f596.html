<p>Time and again, when he is in the midst of serious discussion with someone who is advocating a particular belief, or claiming that a particular action is morally right, Socrates asks two questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What exactly do you mean by that?</li>
<li>What evidence do you have for your claim?</li>
</ol>
<p>In the various dialogues, we see Socrates asking these questions so often that they seem to be his two favorite questions.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1: What Exactly Do You Mean by That?</strong></p>
<p>Socrates would ask this question when he suspected that someone&rsquo;s thinking was muddled. When our thinking is unclear, how can we know whether it does, or does not, correspond to reality? In many cases, after trying to answer Socrates&rsquo;s question, the other person would discover that he really had no clear idea what he was actually claiming. In other words, the person did not really know what he was talking about.</p>
<p>When we reason with other people, we need to define our key words, or else they may not understand what we are saying. A <strong>definition</strong> is an explanation of the meaning of a word or phrase, and a precise definition is an exact explanation. Reasoning with words whose meanings are unclear can be like trying to play catch with puffs of smoke&mdash;hard to get a firm hold on anything. For these reasons, good definitions are an important part of the Socratic method, and of critical thinking generally.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: What Is Your Evidence?</strong></p>
<p>The evidence for a claim is the reason (or reasons) for believing the claim is true, that is, for believing it corresponds to reality. People claim all sorts of things. Some people claim that aliens from a distant galaxy have secretly taken over the U.S. government. Others believe the Earth is actually a hollow sphere (with openings at the poles) and that an advanced civilization secretly inhabits the center of the planet. Interesting claims. However, before accepting controversial claims such as these, Socrates, if he were present, would ask for evidence.</p>
<p>Many times, after Socrates asked someone his second question, the person would discover that he actually had no solid evidence for the claim he was making; in modern terms, &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t have a leg to stand on.&rdquo; This is one of the reasons Socrates concluded that many people are deceiving themselves much of the time.</p>
