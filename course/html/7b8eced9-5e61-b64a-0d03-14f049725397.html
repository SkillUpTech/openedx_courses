<p>In this and the subsequent few topics we'll walk through the steps for using a Venn diagram to test categorical syllogisms for validity.</p>
<p>Once your circles are in place, the following general procedure allows you to test a categorical syllogism for validity. We'll lay out steps 1-5 in this topic and then work through examples in subsequent topics.</p>

<ol>
<li>Abbreviate the argument, replacing (consistently) each term with a single capital letter and retaining the quantifier and copula of each statement. (Example: “Some gems are not green rubies” becomes “Some G are not R.”) By convention we place the conclusion last.</li>
<li>Draw three overlapping circles, one for each term, to form seven distinct regions.</li>
<li>Label the circles using the three capital letters chosen (use the predicate term of the conclusion for the lower right circle, the subject term of the conclusion for the lower left circle, and the middle term for the middle circle).</li>
<li>Enter the information for both premises and stop. Enter only the information for the premises; do not enter information for the conclusion. If the argument contains only one universal premise, enter its information first. If the argument contains two universal premises or two particular premises, either premise can be entered first.</li>
<li>Finally, use the following tests to determine if the argument is valid or invalid.</li>
</ol>
<p>A categorical syllogism is <strong>valid</strong> if, when the information from the two premises has been entered into the diagram, visual inspection of the diagram reveals that the information content of the conclusion is represented as well. In other words, by diagramming only the premises, we have also represented the information found in the conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: This shows that the information contained in the conclusion is already present in the premises. In a sense, the premises contain all the information presented in the conclusion. This in turn means that it would be impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false—a sure sign that an argument is valid.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A categorical syllogism is <strong>invalid</strong> if, when we have diagrammed the information content of the premises, information must be added to the diagram to represent the information content of the conclusion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If the diagram for the premises does not contain all the information in the conclusion, it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false; that is, the conclusion could be false even though the premises are true. In this case, the argument is invalid.</p>
