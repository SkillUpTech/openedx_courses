<p>Reflecting on some of the lessons he had learned from the pronouncement of the oracle, Socrates later said:</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">And isn’t it a bad thing to be deceived about the truth, and a good thing to know what the truth is? For I assume that by knowing the truth [we] mean knowing things as they really are.</p>
<p>Two things are worth noting here. First, Socrates is claiming that knowledge of the truth is intrinsically good and ignorance is intrinsically bad. Philosophers distinguish between intrinsic goodness and extrinsic goodness. Something that is <em>extrinsically</em> good is good only insofar as it can be used as a means of attaining something else that is good. For example, unless one is a numismatist, a dollar bill has only extrinsic value. On the other hand, something is <em>intrinsically</em> good if it is good unto itself, if it is good completely on its own and not merely as a tool or means to get something else that is good. Socrates is claiming here that knowledge is good all by itself, <em>regardless of what it may serve as a means to</em>, and he is saying that ignorance is bad in itself, regardless of what it is used for or leads to.</p>
<p>Second, Socrates is defining truth. Truth, he is saying, is correspondence with reality, that is, with things as they really are. By implication, something is false, or illusory, if it does not correspond to reality. In philosophy, this account of truth, first stated  explicitly by Socrates in Plato’s dialogues, is called the &quot;correspondence theory of truth.&quot; More fully, according to the correspondence theory, a statement or proposition is true if it corresponds to reality; it is false otherwise. Put another way, a statement is true if it  accurately describes or specifies reality; it is false if it does not. (As we saw in an earlier lesson, a statement or proposition may be defined as &quot;that which is expressed by a declarative sentence,&quot; where a  declarative sentence is &quot;a sentence that says something that is either true or false.&quot;)</p>
<p>Putting these two points together, Socrates is claiming that it is intrinsically good
to be in touch with reality, to be aware of things as they really are, rather than to be
ignorant of reality. Truth is inherently better than illusion. He also says that this is an assumption he is making. Although it would be hard to prove this assumption true to someone who steadfastly denies its truth, it would be hard to <em>live</em> as if it were not the case that truth is superior to illusion, wouldn’t it? The notion of truth as correspondence with reality is part of common sense.</p>
