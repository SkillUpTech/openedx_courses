<p>Now that we have background into categorical logic, we can start to construct categorical syllogisms. Remember from a previous lesson that syllogisms have exactly two premises and one conclusion. To this definition, we'll also add the following properties of categorical syllogisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Categorical syllogisms are composed <em>only</em> of categorical statements</li>
<li>Each sentence in the argument contains exactly two terms&mdash;no more, no less.</li>
<li>The argument as a whole contains exactly three different terms, each appearing exactly twice in the argument.</li>
<li>No term appears twice in the same sentence.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following argument is an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All whales are swimmers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All whales are mammals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Therefore, some mammals are swimmers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="middle-major-and-minor-terms-and-standard-form">Middle, Major, and Minor Terms and Standard Form</h2>
<p>The term appearing in both premises (and thus not in the conclusion) is called the <strong>middle term</strong>. The predicate term of the conclusion is called the <strong>major term</strong>. The term appearing as the subject of the conclusion is the <strong>minor term</strong>. The <strong>major premise</strong> is the premise containing the major term, and the <strong>minor premise</strong> is the premise containing the minor term. In the following example, animals is the major term, snakes is the minor term, and pets is the middle term.</p>
<p>1. All pets are animals</p>
<p>2. Some snakes are pets</p>
<p>3. So, necessarily, some snakes are animals</p>
<p><strong>A categorical syllogism is in standard form if the major premise is listed first, followed by the minor premise, and finally the conclusion</strong>.</p>
<p>Because categorical syllogisms follow these strict rules of form, there is a limited, valid set of arrangements they can be in and we'll look at those arrangements or <em>forms</em> in the next topic.</p>
