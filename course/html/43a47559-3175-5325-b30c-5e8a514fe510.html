<p>When scientists track down the causes of things, the procedures they use are often based on a set of principles first formulated by the British philosopher John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) in his System of Logic published in 1843. These principles, now known
as “Mill’s methods,” state procedures for identifying probable causes. Most of the principles are common sense. However, before we survey Mill’s methods, we must first clarify the concept of a cause.</p>
<h2 id="cause-and-effect">Cause and Effect</h2>
<p>One of the key objectives of causal investigation is to discover, for a specified effect, the conditions under which the effect will or will not occur. Likewise, a key question of causal reasoning is this: under which conditions will the effect occur and under which conditions will the effect be absent? Thus, philosophers have found it illuminating to analyze causes in terms of underlying, or antecedent, conditions, and specifically in terms of two types of antecedents, or underlying, conditions: necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. Recall from an earlier lesson that a <strong>necessary condition</strong> for something X is a condition that is required; without the necessary condition, X will not obtain. For example, oxygen is necessary for a fire to burn. A <strong>sufficient condition</strong> for something X is a condition that guarantees that X will obtain; the sufficient condition is all that is needed for the obtaining of X. For example, jumping in a lake is sufficient for being wet. Notice that although oxygen is necessary for a fire to burn, it is not sufficient; while jumping in a lake is sufficient for getting wet but is not a necessary condition for getting wet. Mill’s methods are commonsense guides for discovering causally necessary and
sufficient conditions.</p>
<p>In the next sections, we'll look at the specifics of Mill's Method and how the method can be used to determine cause.</p>
