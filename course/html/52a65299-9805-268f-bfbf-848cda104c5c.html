<p>As we saw in a previous topic, categorical logic uses just three terms to establish all the interesting relationships between terms that we care about: some, all and none (or no).</p>
<p>Using these terms, there are four basic patterns or forms that a categorical sentence might follow:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>State that all the members of one category belong to a second category; for example, “All cats belong to the category of mammals,” or simply, “All cats are mammals.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>State that none of one category belong to a second category; for example, “No cats belong to the category of fish,” or simply, “No cats are fish.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>State that some members of one category belong to a second category; for example, &quot;Some cats belong to the category of pets,&quot; or simply, &quot;Some cats are pets.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><p>State that some members of one category do not belong to a second category; for example, &quot;Some cats do not belong to the category of pets,&quot; or simply, &quot;Some cats are not pets.&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our example of the first pattern is, &quot;All cats are mammals.&quot; Aristotle broke this type of categorical sentence down into four parts, named as follows:</p>
<p><strong>The quantifier</strong>: All</p>
<p><strong>The subject term</strong>: cats</p>
<p><strong>The copula</strong>: are</p>
<p><strong>The predicate term</strong>: mammals</p>
<p>All four sentence types follow this basic pattern and understanding this pattern will be important as we work through how these statements are used in arguments.</p>
<h2 id="all-and-none">All and None</h2>
<p>The terms &quot;all&quot; and &quot;none,&quot; as their use in English grammar denotes, <em>quantifies</em> or tells us the number of the subject term that belong to the class denoted by the predicate term. Thus, &quot;all cats are pets&quot; means that every cat that exists is a member of the category or class &quot;pet&quot; and &quot;no cats are fish&quot; means that no cat that exists is a part of the category &quot;fish.&quot;</p>
<h2 id="some">Some</h2>
<p>&quot;Some aardvarks are pets&quot; asserts that some members of the subject category (aardvarks) are included within the predicate category (pets). But what exactly does the word some mean? This seemingly innocent little word turns out, on close inspection, to be ambiguous. A definition is needed to make things more precise. Two interpretations are possible:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Some can mean “one or more but not all.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>Some can mean “one or more,” that is, “at least one.”</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Aristotle chose the second meaning, and it has become the standard in logic. Thus, in standard categorical logic, the word some shall mean &quot;one or more,&quot; which means the same as &quot;at least one.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Some aardvarks are not pets&quot; says that some (one or more) members of the subject class are not included in the predicate class; that is, one or more aardvarks do not belong to the class of pets.</p>
