<p>In order to better understand how computers &quot;think,&quot; we can start with the simplest version of a computer: the Turing machine. A Turing machine isn't really a machine but a model for describing how computers do what they do.</p>
<p>The model was invented by computer scientist Alan Turing who many consider the father of digital computing. Turing realized that all computational problems can be broken down into a very simple language, a digital language: 0 and 1. That's pretty simple, right? One way to think about Turing's insight is in terms of two states like &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;, &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false, &quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; or &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot;. You can create a Turing machine out of anything that can be in two different states. One philosopher suggested that a Turing machine can be made from birds pecking: when the bird's head is up, it's in the &quot;0&quot; position and when it's down, it's in the &quot;1&quot; position.</p>
<p>In many ways, the light switch on your wall is a digital machine. When the light switch is on, it's in one state and when it's off it's in another--and those are the only two states the light switch can be in. While not a lot of information can be communicated with that switch, just by looking at it, we can tell what state the light is in (assume for a second that you can't see the actual light the switch controls).</p>
<p>All modern computers are essentially very complex Turing machines turning switches--lots of switches--on and off very rapidly to do all the magical things a computer does.</p>
<h2 id="but-wait">But Wait!</h2>
<p>How can a switch create all the interesting graphics, process data in a spreadsheet, create text messages and digital phone calls, produce holographic images, and all the other cool things our computers do? It's a bit more complicated than a simple light switch (you probably knew this was coming).</p>
<p>The foundation of computer systems and the logic that makes them up are made up of sets of switches all working together. Let's extend our light switch example to see how this works. Suppose we have two light switches that when used in various combinations produce different colored lights. Here are the combinations we can create (using 0 for off and 1 for on):</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Switch 1</th>
<th>Switch 2</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If each combination &quot;turns on&quot; a different color, we can now have three different color lights using just two switches (when both switches are off the light is off). For example:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Switch 1</th>
<th>Switch 2</th>
<th>Color</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Off</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Red</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>Green</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
<td>Blue</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If we add just one more switch, we can add four more colors! This is the insight that Alan Turing discovered. By using this simple digital language you can create very complex combinations that can represent just about anything.</p>

<p>In the next lesson we'll look at how this digital language is used in computer science to create the complex computers we enjoy and use today.</p>
