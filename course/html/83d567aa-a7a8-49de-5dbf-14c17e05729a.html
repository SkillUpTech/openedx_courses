<p>In the previous lesson we looked at two argument forms: the modus ponens and the modus tollens. These forms are always valid and regardless of the values you use for 'p' and 'q', the argument will still be valid (though not necessarily sound). There are two fallacies that are related to these valid forms and briefly looking at them may help you understand how the valid forms work.</p>
<p>These fallacies are called <em>formal fallacies</em> because they are errors with the <strong>form</strong> of the argument. Formal fallacies are contrasted with <em>informal fallacies</em> which have to do with the <strong>content</strong> of the argument.</p>
<h2 id="formal-fallacy-1-affirming-the-consequent">Formal Fallacy 1: Affirming the Consequent</h2>
<p>This fallacy is associated with the modus ponens argument form. As you'll recall, the modus ponens has the following structure:</p>
<ol>
<li>p --&gt; q</li>
<li>p</li>
<li>Therefore: q</li>
</ol>
<p>We affirm that the antecedent of the first premise is true and that allows us to conclude that the consequent of the first premise also is true. The fallacious version of this attempts to affirm the consequent is true and then conclude that the antecedent is true. It looks like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>p --&gt; q</li>
<li>q</li>
<li>Therefore p</li>
</ol>
<p>This is fallacious reasoning. Let's look at the fallacious version of the argument we looked at for the modus ponens argument form to see why:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Jerry grows a mustache then George will grow a mustache</li>
<li>George grows a mustache</li>
<li>Therefore, Jerry will grow a mustache</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the first premise doesn't tell us anything about what must be true if George grows a mustache. It only tells us that George will grow one <em>if</em> Jerry grows one. That's it. Because of this, affirming the consequent in premise two does not allow us to affirm the antecedent in the conclusion. We've reasoned fallaciously.</p>
<h2 id="formal-fallacy-2-denying-the-antecedent">Formal Fallacy 2: Denying the Antecedent</h2>
<p>This fallacy is associated with the modus tollens argument form. Now that you understand how fallacies work, let's briefly look at this fallacy and see if you can understand why it's a fallacious form. First, go back and review the modus tollens argument form in the previous lesson then examine this fallacious form:</p>
<ol>
<li>p --&gt; q</li>
<li>~p</li>
<li>Therefore ~q</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that in this form, we're attempting to deny the antecedent rather than the consequent as we do in the valid form. Now, replace 'p' and 'q' with actual statements (you can use the argument we looked at in the modus tollens lesson). Can you understand why this form is fallacious? Post a question in the discussion form if you're not sure.</p>
