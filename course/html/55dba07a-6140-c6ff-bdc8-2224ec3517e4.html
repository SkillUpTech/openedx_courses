<p>The ancient philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BCE) established many of the foundations of Western thought that many of us take for granted. In fact, his philosophy is so commonplace that it is difficult for us to imagine what the world would be like without it. For example, Aristotle laid the foundation for what we now know as modern science. He laid down the rules for scientific classification that in one way or another is essentially the framework we use today.</p>
<p>One of his achievements was to give us the framework for classification that is essential in biology, chemistry, and many other disciplines. For example, there are many types of cats in the world. You may have a variety of one of these ancient creatures as a pet. But there are many wild varieties like lions, cougars, lynx, and tigers that bear some resemblance to your house cat but differ in important ways. Still, we lump them all under the genus <em>Felis</em>. Cats also are categorized under the class <em>mammalia</em> and the order <em>carnivora</em>. This class and order include animals other than cats and have common characteristics that cats share that provide the basis for their membership into these classifications. Even if you've never formally studied biology, you're most likely familiar with classifications like these and its hard to imagine thinking about the world of biology without them.</p>
<p>But there was a time when a system like this wasn't even thought of. It was Aristotle that first set down the methodology for making classifications such as these and it changed the way humans saw the world. One of the tools Aristotle developed to help establish his methodology was an early logical system that has come to be known as categorical logic.</p>
<h2 id="the-logic-of-categories">The Logic of Categories</h2>
<p>When you think about it, a genus, species, class, and order are all ways of <em>categorizing</em> things. You've most likely used a catalog at some point. If you've done any online shopping for clothes, you may have browsed a list of shoes and may have filtered the list to brown, leather shoes without laces. The <em>catalog</em> provides logical groupings or <em>categories</em> (from which the word catalog is derived) of the things you shopped for to make it easier to find what you're looking for.</p>
<p>You can think of a category as boundary: some things are inside the boundary, and other things are outside the boundary. The things that are inside the boundary--cats or shoes for example--all share some things in common. The things that don't have those shared characteristics are outside the boundary (but most likely are in another category shared with other things). Very simply, categorical logic is the science of analyzing groupings of ideas and discovering relationships between ideas using those groupings.</p>
<p>Consider this argument put in terms of categorical logic:</p>
<p>Premise 1: All cats are mammals</p>
<p>Premise 2: Some cats have fur</p>
<p>Conclusion: Therefore some mammals have fur</p>
<p>The terms <em>all</em> and <em>some</em> are categorical terms. They provide a vocabulary for talking about classes of things and using that vocabulary, we can establish relationships between terms (and the ideas those terms represent). In the above argument, we establish two categorical truths and it enables us to conclude a third categorical truth based on the truth of those premises. You might not find the above argument very informative but that's not really the point. The argument shows that using the logic of categories, we can learn rules for how terms and the ideas and things those terms symbolize are related to one another. As we've been learning, this is the magic of logic.</p>
