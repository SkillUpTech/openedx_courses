<h1 id="introduce-yourself">Introduce Yourself</h1>
<p>You can introduce yourself to your classmates by expanding the course discussion board and responding to the &quot;Introduce Yourself!&quot; topic. Just like in a physical classroom, this digital classroom has the potential to provide great networking opportunities, so please also take the time to read and respond to your fellow classmates' introductions (click &quot;Show Discussion&quot; to get started)!</p>
<p>This discussion and all course discussions can be accessed any time from the &quot;Discussion&quot; tab above.</p>
