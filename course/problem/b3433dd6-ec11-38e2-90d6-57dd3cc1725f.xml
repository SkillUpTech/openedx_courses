        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p/>
        <p>The term "any" indicates that every drop you encounter will be salty. So we use the term "all" to signify that in standard form. Be sure to use "are" as the copula and specify the object in the predicate; in this case we use "things" as the predicate.<br/></p>
