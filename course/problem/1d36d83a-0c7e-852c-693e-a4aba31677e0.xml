    <p>Examine this argument:<br/>
Exercising daily helps prevent heart attacks. Don exercises daily. Therefore, Don will probably never suffer a heart attack.<br/></p>
    <label>Does this inductive argument seem to be strong or weak?<br/></label>

        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p/>
        <p>This is weak because there are a lot of other factors that would need to be considered before one can determine whether Don is a heart attack candidate. One data point generally is not sufficient to determine the probability that a conclusion is true. More importantly, there is a logical disconnect between the concept of "prevention" and Don "never" suffering a heart attack. Prevention is a relatively weak concept and never is an absolute concept. The former doesn't support the latter inductively.<br/></p>
