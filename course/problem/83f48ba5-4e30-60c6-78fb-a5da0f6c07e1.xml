    <p>Examine this argument:<br/>
Ed is walking the twelve miles to downtown. He just left five minutes ago. He walks at an ordinary pace. Therefore, probably he has not arrived yet.<br/></p>
    <label>Does this inductive argument seem to be strong or weak?<br/></label>

        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p/>
        <p>This might seem to be deductive since even the fastest recorded runner could only cover a little over 1 mile in 5 minutes. The reason it is inductive is because Ed could have hopped in a cab or hitched a ride with a friend. We have good reason to believe he walked but it's not certain.<br/></p>
