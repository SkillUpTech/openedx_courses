this video, we look at","the premium capabilities of Azure Cosmos DB.","If you have applications written","on Azure tables storage and need","premium capabilities like global distribution,","single-digit millisecond latency,","automatic secondary indexes or four nines availability,","then you can start using Azure Cosmos DB's table API","to take advantage of","these benefits without making","any core changes to your application.","So let's take a closer look","at these premium capabilities.","The first difference is every table","in Azure Cosmos DB has provision throughput.","So you can reserve throughput in terms of","requests per second and start to","get hundreds of requests per second and go","all the way up to millions of requests per second.","And this throughput is reserved for","your table and it's guaranteed by the service","regardless of how much data you have under storage","or how many requests are going on at the same time.","The service seamlessly skins out storage.","But in addition to the storage,","the service also builds an automatic index based","on the content in your entities within the table.","So when you run queries against the service,","these are served from the index and are","executed efficiently and with low latency.","You can also look at the detailed metrics in","the Azure portal for data distribution across partitions,","skews within your partition key distribution and so on.","The service guarantees high availability.","You can get four nines availability","within a single region,","and this is backed by SLAs.","And you can achieve higher availability","by choosing multi-region deployments.","The service also guarantees latency,","so your reads and writes","complete within single digit milliseconds.","In this case, you can see that the reads for this account","complete in under one millisecond","and writes complete in under five milliseconds.","But, the service in addition to this,","guarantees that the high end latency,","so at the 99th percentile is under 10 milliseconds for","reads and under 15 milliseconds for writes.","So in addition to these differences,","the service also provides turnkey global distribution.","So when you provision tables,","you can associate not just one or two regions","but as many as up to 40 regions,","to have your data seamlessly distributed.","Which means that applications that are running in","these regions can talk to the local copy,","using the multi homing API support","that's available in the Cosmos DB,","your table is secure.","So in this case, I have my data spread","across five geographic regions.","At any point in time,","you can perform manual failovers to","test the business continuity of your application.","Now the STKs provided by","the Azure Cosmos DB NuGet package","can perform automatic region discovery.","So in the event of a regional failover,","then the STKs can recover without","any availability loss or data loss to your application.","The service also provides nobs for automatic failover.","So in the event of a natural disaster,","you can specify precisely the priority of","regions by which the service should perform failovers.","So, you can control","the failover to happen in a region in which","the standby for your application is deployed.","Let's take a look at the performance difference","using the premium API as well","as the standard table storage.","So in this case, I have an account that is","deployed in Azure in the West US region.","So I have a VM running in San Francisco,","the performance results running against","a regular table storage as well as premium table storage.","So, I'll run through this again,","but let me walk you through some of the numbers.","This application is available for download from GitHub.","And when you deploy any table storage account","from the QuickStart in your Cosmos DB account,","you can download this exact application","that I'm about to show you.","So in this case, I just run","through basic grid operations,","read and write, with","both the standard and premium table accounts.","So, you can see that with standard table storage,","the fastest insert I run about 1,000 inserts,","the fastest insert completed in about six milliseconds.","At the 99th percentile you can","see the performance somewhat slower.","So it's about 70 milliseconds at the 99th percentile.","If you compare the performance with the premium tables,","now the fastest write","completed in under five millisecond and","the slowest write completed in under 11 milliseconds.","Similarly for reads, you can see the performance ranges","between 2.8 milliseconds and 10 milliseconds.","With the premium API, of course,","you can see the fastest read completed in a millisecond","and the slowest read completed in about four millisecond.","Where do you start seeing some bigger differences","is when you perform queries.","So in this case, you can see for example,","we have a query that is","performed in premium storage, of course,","against the secondary index and","the queries also complete","in around single-digit millisecond latency.","When you have global distribution,","you get the same performance not just within","the collocated data center but anywhere across the world.","So now, I have another VM that's running in","the Singapore region and I ran the exact same experiment.","But with premium storage you can","see that even though Singapore is","about 160 milliseconds away from the West US data center,","I could still perform reads.","So in this case, reads are still","completing within 1-3 milliseconds","and queries are completing again","in the order of 5-10 milliseconds.","And this is possible due to","the power of global distribution.","So in this video, we looked at the premium capabilities","of Azure Cosmos DB and how you can","migrate applications written using","Azure table storage and need","premium capabilities to Azure Cosmos DB's table API."]}
