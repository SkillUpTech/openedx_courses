In this video,","we'll cover recording documents in","Azure Cosmos DB with the MongoDB API Flickr.","We'll use something that","most MongoDB developers are all ready familiar with,","which is the MongoDB shell,","to execute some simple queries.","In order to get started,","I'm already on the Azure portal and we'll","navigate over to our Azure Cosmos DB database.","So within the portal, find","your Cosmos DB resource and open up the link.","As you can already see,","I have an anhoh-mongo account already created,","and so I will open that up,","and then I'll navigate over to our Quick start.","So in the Quick start,","you conveniently put the command line","for opening up your Mongo shell","and automatically connecting over to","your Cosmos DB database.","So, I'll copy that over and I'll open on","my terminal and I'm","already inside the directory with my Mongo Shell.","You can see here.","And so, I'll paste","in what I've copied over from the actual portal.","Link that then connect it to the Azure Cosmos DB.","So, I can quickly show the databases.","I have an admin edx database.","For this video, I'll be using the edx database.","I'll show what collections I have in edx.","I have a core collection, which I've already created,","which includes 10 sample documents about volcanoes.","And so, I will quickly do a find,","to show what documents are inside this collection.","You can see volcano data","and I'll verify that this has 10 documents.","Yes. Perfect. This is a little","bit difficult to read and so I can take","just a simple document","and we can take","a little bit closer look at its properties.","So, I do have volcano data inside of this collection.","We have the ID, which is Abu, volcano name is also Abu,","country Japan, the region,","location, elevation, type, status,","and lat known eruption.","Let me just clear the screen.","Okay. And so, now we can do","a simple query to just return to volcano.","There you go.","We have returned documents with Abu and","now we can do a little bits more advanced,","a little bit more filtering on this and so we","could return on to volcanoes that have","an elevation greater than 3000.","You can see here,","there are 1, 2, 3,","4 volcanoes that have an elevation greater than 3000.","It looks like there is only one volcano","that has an elevation greater than 6000.","And so, if I were to rerun the same query,","but with 6000, you should get one document back.","Perfect. As you can see this is a bit messy","and so we can decide to","only take a select number of properties from this.","So I take the first query.","So, let me just clear the screen.","So I take the first query which I ran,","which is the elevation,","greater than 3000, and pulls off","the code brackets and then we can decide to","just have the name come up.","Here we come, and as you","can see we have the four volcanoes,","with just there names.","If we want to verify that this","is actually their elevations and they are","actually greater than 3000 and we can","also project out the elevation.","As you can see here, these are all the volcanoes that","have above 3000 elevations.","And so this is just some simple query ability in","queries against the Azure Cosmos","DB MongoDB API Flickr Database."]}
