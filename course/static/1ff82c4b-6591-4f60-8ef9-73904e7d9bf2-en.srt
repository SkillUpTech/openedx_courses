00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:03,510
We've been looking at how to construct good arguments.

1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,670
We've looked at statements and propositions.

2
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,350
We've looked at truth value.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,880
Now we're looking at argument form,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,570
how to put arguments together.

5
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,340
In a previous lesson, we looked at the concept of validity and

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,330
invalidity.

7
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,380
A valid argument is an argument that is in the proper form.

8
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:22,730
I tried to illustrate how you can look at an argument and

9
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:25,880
tell whether the argument works just by looking at the form

10
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,150
of the argument.

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,190
What I wanna do now is show you how you can use symbolization

12
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:32,890
to determine validity,

13
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,350
how you can use symbolization to determine validity.

14
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:39,990
Symbolization is a concept that most people have been using

15
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,858
since they were in their early schooling.

16
00:00:42,858 --> 00:00:47,110
We use it a lot in mathematics, where we replace numerals

17
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,600
with symbols so that we can better understand a structure.

18
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:55,010
And we can replace those symbols with other numerals, so

19
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,020
that we can have other formulas or we

20
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:03,480
can create new formulas by just plugging in different numbers.

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,440
We do it in mathematics all the time.

22
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,500
Logic has the same concept.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,540
We can replace simple sentences and obviously,

24
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:15,370
compound sentences based on those simple sentences

25
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:19,340
by replacing those sentences, those statements with symbols.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,910
And when we symbolize an argument,

27
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,370
we can actually see the structure a lot better.

28
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,340
It's easier to see the structure cuz we are not distracted

29
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:29,310
by the truth value of those statements that we

30
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,450
are looking at and then we can also tell validity.

31
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:34,590
We can also tell whether an argument is valid or

32
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,140
invalid just based on that structure, which

33
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,540
we're gonna be able to determine by looking at it symbolically.

34
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,990
Let's take an argument here and we want to determine

35
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,500
whether this is a valid structure or not.

36
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:52,460
Remember I said validity only has to do with form,

37
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:54,680
only has to do with the structure of the argument, and

38
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,680
not with the truth value of the premises.

39
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,970
We're gonna look at this argument,

40
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,860
all humans are irrational.

41
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,700
All rational things are conscious, or

42
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,430
you can say all rational things are conscious things.

43
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,180
Therefore, all humans are conscious.

44
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,960
This argument has a very specific logical structure and

45
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,670
we're gonna be able to tell that structure

46
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,790
simply by the way that the argument is put together.

47
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:22,980
We can look at that structure by looking at its form.

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,560
Here is the same argument in symbolic form.

49
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,150
We are going to replace human with H, rational with R, and

50
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,790
conscious with C and now we have

51
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:36,160
the argument structure much more clearly here.

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,100
All H are R, all R are C, therefore, all H are C.

53
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:45,210
Now what's important about this structure is this is a valid

54
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:49,100
logical form, and it doesn't matter what you plug into H,

55
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,569
R and C, it will always be valid.

56
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:56,310
Now, you can say, how can you tell if it's valid if you don't

57
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,570
know what the letters mean?

58
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:00,010
That's the exact point.

59
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:02,460
Validity only has to do with the structure,

60
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,770
it has nothing to do with the meaning or

61
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,860
the truth value of those statements that we're gonna

62
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,250
replace those variables with, those symbols with.

63
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:15,920
Symbols are valuable in that they can help us understand

64
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,440
the structure of an argument, whether the argument is valid or

65
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,410
invalid.

66
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:21,130
Obviously, as you're learning these things,

67
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,980
you'll have to learn the proper forms,

68
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,370
you'll have to learn the proper structure.

69
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,480
I'll give you some later on but for right now,

70
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,670
all we're concerned with is looking at the symbolic form and

71
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:35,410
then being able to tell whether that form is valid or invalid.

72
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,430
By the way, you probably intuitively can tell whether or

73
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:42,090
not the conclusion follows from the premises in the way that

74
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,420
this argument is formed.

75
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,780
You have an intuition whether the argument is valid because

76
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,890
you can tell that the conclusion does follow from the premises.

77
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:52,950
But there are structures that logicians have come up with

78
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,280
that you can memorize so

79
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,200
you can tell whether an argument is in the right form.
