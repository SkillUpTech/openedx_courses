0
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,680
All right, we've been looking at how to construct logical

1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,190
arguments.

2
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:06,820
We've looked at statements and propositions.

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:08,410
We've been looking at argument form,

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,820
the concept of validity and invalidity.

5
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,710
We've looked at simple statements, and

6
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,104
compound statements, and symbols, replacing those simple

7
00:00:16,104 --> 00:00:20,590
and compound statements with their symbolic representation.

8
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,950
And the final tool that I wanna present to you is looking

9
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,540
at operators.

10
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,900
We wanna look at how operators work to combine

11
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,750
simple statements into compound statements.

12
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,550
And these operators are going to be used in constructing

13
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,270
arguments in your premises in your conclusion.

14
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,490
I'm gonna give you four.

15
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,743
There are others but

16
00:00:39,743 --> 00:00:43,061
I'm gonna give four main operators that you can use to

17
00:00:43,061 --> 00:00:46,536
construct most arguments as you need to do that, okay?

18
00:00:46,536 --> 00:00:49,910
So let's look at the first operator.

19
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:52,720
This operator's called the negation, all right?

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,400
It has a symbol and you can find this on most keyboards.

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,010
The tilde symbol is the operator for negation.

22
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:01,710
It looks exactly like that.

23
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:03,230
I don't know if you can see that,

24
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,480
you'll have to zoom in [LAUGH] on your screen there and

25
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:07,080
the negation.

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,030
All the negation does is changes the truth value of

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:17,000
the proposition that follows the negation symbol, all right?

28
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,840
So the way we would symbolize a negation is using the tilde

29
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:25,790
with the symbol for that proposition, all right?

30
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,950
So let's say that A stands for Ann is home.

31
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:31,004
The tilde in front of it means,

32
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:34,095
it is not the case that Ann is home, all right.

33
00:01:34,095 --> 00:01:36,520
And that's how we would phrase this.

34
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,360
That's all the negation does is it flips the truth

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,080
value in our argument.

36
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,380
We would write it this way symbolically or

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,900
we would write it out that way.

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,800
We could also say not, it is not the case that Ann is home,

39
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,660
or not a is the other way that you would word this.

40
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:55,820
Now it's really important, the way I have it structured here,

41
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,860
the way I have it worded is actually is quite important

42
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:01,530
when you're constructing arguments in logic.

43
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:04,360
We could say Ann is not home, correct?

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:07,740
This would have exactly the same meaning, right?

45
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,990
If Ann is home is true, and we wanted to reverse that and

46
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:13,260
say that, it's not the case that Ann is home or

47
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,126
reverse the truth value we can say that Ann is not home.

48
00:02:16,126 --> 00:02:19,380
But the way that I have it written here it is to say,

49
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:21,760
it is not the case that Ann is home.

50
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,520
Why did I write it that way?

51
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,100
Well, we wanna keep our simple sentence preserved,

52
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,990
we wanna keep Ann is home as a simple sentence

53
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:33,360
the way that it is without adding a new word to it.

54
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,990
Ann is home is our simple statement, if you remember

55
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:39,390
the lesson on simple statements earlier in the course.

56
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,200
We wanna keep that simple statement preserved.

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,420
And we negate it by simply saying, it is not the case that.

58
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,961
Right, and that's gonna be very important when we're

59
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:51,829
constructing logical arguments because if you start changing

60
00:02:51,829 --> 00:02:54,654
the sentences, if you start changing the simple sentences.

61
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,572
You're gonna lose track of what simple sentences you're

62
00:02:57,572 --> 00:02:58,870
working with.

63
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,080
So always stated as not a or it is not the case that and

64
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,030
then your simple sentence.

65
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,450
Ann is home, Bob is home,

66
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,460
the grass is green whatever it is, right?

67
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,760
Try to keep your simple sentences preserved, so

68
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,640
the negation symbol will be structured exactly like that.

69
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,980
All right so, that's the first

70
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,180
symbol that we're gonna be concerned with, the negation.

71
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,640
The second one is called the conjunction,

72
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,360
the conjunction symbol.

73
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,570
And this is the and operator.

74
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,310
In logic, you can use an ampersand or a dot.

75
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,110
In some older logic textbooks, you'll see an ampersand used.

76
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:37,880
Modern textbooks tend to use the little dot symbol.

77
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,480
If you're a computer programmer, again you're gonna see some of

78
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,590
these symbols starting to show up in formal logic, ones that

79
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,080
you already are used to using in computer programming.

80
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,460
They operate exactly the same way, right?

81
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,050
So in a conjunction, I'll go back

82
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,580
to the bottom here the under the example, Ann is home.

83
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,555
A simple statement and we join it to another simple statement,

84
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:02,381
Bob is home.

85
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:06,251
We can symbolize that as A & B or A.B and we're simply

86
00:04:06,251 --> 00:04:10,560
joining two simple statements by using that and operator.

87
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,890
This is called a conjunction.

88
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,760
Ann is home and Bob is home,

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,258
is called a conjunction, a compound statement.

90
00:04:19,258 --> 00:04:23,800
And each simple

91
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,300
statement in the conjunction is called a conjunct.

92
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,520
So I'm gonna say, Ann is home is a conjunct.

93
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,640
Bob is home is a conjunct.

94
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:36,840
In the conjunction, Ann is home and Bob is home.

95
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,595
Right, so when you're referring to parts of a conjunction,

96
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:42,340
you're gonna refer to those parts as conjunct.

97
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,830
When you're referring to the simple statements,

98
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,330
each simple statements is a conjunct.

99
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,960
By the way, you can have multiple simple statements

100
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:53,290
conjoined using the symbols here, right?

101
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:57,711
You could say, Ann is home and Bob is home, and Kyle is out,

102
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:59,880
and John is swimming.

103
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:04,020
Now you've got a conjunction with four conjuncts and

104
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:06,220
each will have it's own truth value and

105
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:11,360
those will work together to give the entire conjunction

106
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,960
a single truth value of true or false, right?

107
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,340
So that's the second operator that you're going to be using.

108
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,340
Conjunction, first one was negation,

109
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:21,563
now let's go to our third one.

110
00:05:21,563 --> 00:05:24,796
This is the disjunction operator.

111
00:05:24,796 --> 00:05:30,885
This is the or operator in our tool kit,

112
00:05:30,885 --> 00:05:34,545
so the or operator uses the v on your keyboard or

113
00:05:34,545 --> 00:05:37,195
if you're writing it out, you just write it out like a v,

114
00:05:37,195 --> 00:05:38,615
it's called a wedge in logic.

115
00:05:39,885 --> 00:05:43,410
And it's constructed very similarly to the conjunction,

116
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:46,297
only the way that the truth value works is gonna be

117
00:05:46,297 --> 00:05:47,083
different.

118
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,560
So here we have Ann is home or Bob is home.

119
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,510
Each will have it's own truth value.

120
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:54,530
It creates a compound sentence,

121
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,250
a compound statement, joined by that conjunction.

122
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,450
Sorry, joined by that disjunction symbol and

123
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,090
then, the whole thing is called a disjunction.

124
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:07,750
As in conjunction, each part of the disjunction

125
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:10,210
has a specific name called the disjunct.

126
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,910
So Ann is home.

127
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:13,300
Simple statement,

128
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:17,180
that's a disjunct in the disjunction compound sentence.

129
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,140
And Bob is home is also a disjunct.

130
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,610
And we can refer to each of those parts

131
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,679
as a disjunct when we're talking through the argument.

132
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,710
Notice that we can combine disjunction and conjunction.

133
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:32,770
We can say Ann is home or Bob is home and

134
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,530
Kyle is swimming, right?

135
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:37,590
Now, we've combined the conjunction with

136
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,550
the disjunction.

137
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,640
We can also throw in negation in there if we wanted to.

138
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,860
We could say Ann is home or Bob is home and Kyle is swimming,

139
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,170
but it is not the case that Susie is riding her bike, right?

140
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:52,450
So we can bring all of these operators together to

141
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:53,970
create more complex,

142
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:57,973
compound statements and each of these has its truth value.

143
00:06:57,973 --> 00:07:01,364
Now I want to just take a moment to look at how truth value works

144
00:07:01,364 --> 00:07:03,400
in each of these scenarios.

145
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,910
So let's took at conjunction again.

146
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:09,140
Suppose I said, Ann is home is true and

147
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:12,950
Bob is home is true, what is the truth value, do you think of

148
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:18,260
the entire compound statement, the conjunction as a whole?

149
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,430
Well, if both conjuncts are true,

150
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:24,560
doesn't it seem the entire conjunction would be true.

151
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,750
If we're gonna say Ann is home and Bob is home and

152
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,250
Ann is home is true and Bob is home is true,

153
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,770
the whole thing would be true, right?

154
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,090
Because both simple statements are true.

155
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:35,770
Now let's change Bob is home to false.

156
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:38,990
Ann is home and Bob is home but Bob is home is actually

157
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,530
false, what do you think the truth value of the entire

158
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,300
conjunction would be.

159
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:45,950
Intuitively, doesn't it seem it would be false because now we're

160
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,450
saying that these statements since one of them is false,

161
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,580
the whole thing has to be false.

162
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,400
So in that condition, the entire conjunction would have

163
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:59,340
a truth value of false because one of the conjuncts is false.

164
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,990
We can do the same thing with disjunction, right?

165
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:04,587
Ann is home or Bob is home.

166
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:06,334
Let's suppose both are true,

167
00:08:06,334 --> 00:08:09,990
it would seem that the entire disjunction is true.

168
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,420
Now let's change Bob is home to false.

169
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,040
Ann is home or Bob is home.

170
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,390
What are your intuitions tell you?

171
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:21,260
Actually in a disjunction, if either disjunct is true,

172
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,268
then the entire disjunction is true still, right.

173
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:28,080
So in conjunction, it made the whole conjunction false.

174
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,992
In disjunction, we can have one of the disjuncts as false and

175
00:08:31,992 --> 00:08:34,995
still the whole disjunction is true, right.

176
00:08:34,995 --> 00:08:36,860
Cuz think about that intuitively.

177
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,050
Ann is home or Bob is home.

178
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,520
Bob is home is false.

179
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,970
Ann is home is true, the disjunction is still true.

180
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:46,380
Now, if we changed both to false, Ann is home is false, and

181
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:50,190
Bob is home is false, then the whole disjunction becomes false,

182
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:54,250
right, that we have an intuition that that's a false statement.

183
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,740
Right, so that's how truth value relates to our symbols, and

184
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:02,130
our operators in constructing logical arguments.

185
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,440
So we have negation, we have conjunction, we have disjunction

186
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,390
and I'm going to give you one more called the conditional.

187
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:13,060
This is a very important construct in logic and

188
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,380
you'll use it pretty heavily when you're creating arguments.

189
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:20,660
Under the conditional, you'll use the arrow or the horseshoe.

190
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,930
You can use either, again, modern textbooks generally

191
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:29,200
go with the arrow symbol for the conditional.

192
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,528
They're called horseshoe [LAUGH] and arrow,

193
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,570
obviously under the symbol name.

194
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,010
The construction is down here at the bottom,

195
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,700
if you look under the example.

196
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,360
If Ann is home then, Bob is home.

197
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,720
That's how we write a conditional.

198
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,610
The way that is symbolized is you put the first symbol

199
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,150
sentence before the operator.

200
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:51,750
So here we have A horseshoe B or A arrow B.

201
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:56,290
A is the first simple statement, B is the second.

202
00:09:56,290 --> 00:10:00,030
And the B follows what would be essentially the then statement

203
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,316
if we were writing it out in English, okay.

204
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,330
The conjunction and the disjunction,

205
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:12,760
each part of the conditional has a specific label,

206
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:15,450
a name that logicians have given it. okay.

207
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,320
The part that follows the if or

208
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:20,860
the part that comes before the symbol is called the antecedent.

209
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,950
So that would be the A or Ann is home in our example here.

210
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,050
That's called the antecedent.

211
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:32,050
The simple statement that follows the horseshoe,

212
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,010
follows the symbol or

213
00:10:34,010 --> 00:10:38,090
follows the then in English, is called the consequent.

214
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:41,730
Right, the antecedent and the consequent.

215
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:45,730
Right, so here Bob is home then function is in the consequent.

216
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:48,370
Ann is home, function as the antecedent.

217
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,510
And it's always written that way, okay?

218
00:10:51,510 --> 00:10:54,710
Now, notice too that the simple statement does not include

219
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:59,550
the if, the if is a part of the symbol itself,

220
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,100
the operator itself.

221
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,130
So if I were to ask you,

222
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:05,740
what is the antecedent of the example down here below?

223
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,390
You would say,

224
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:10,650
the antecedent is, Ann is home, not if Ann is home.

225
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:13,860
You leave the if and the then off the simple statements.

226
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,383
The consequent of this statement here,

227
00:11:16,383 --> 00:11:20,400
this conditional is Bob is home not then Bob is home, all right?

228
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,275
The if and the then are a part of the operator,

229
00:11:23,275 --> 00:11:27,390
they don't get included in the simple statements, all right?

230
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:29,580
Now again, you can add other operators here.

231
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:34,100
And say if Ann is home then Bob is home and Kyle is swimming,

232
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:38,625
right, you can group those together to use the symbols and

233
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,336
the operators in conjunction with each other.

234
00:11:42,336 --> 00:11:44,490
All right, so those are four operators.

235
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:47,660
You can use these operators to build compound statements

236
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,200
that then you can use in your logical arguments.

237
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,880
As we get further into the course, your gonna see how these

238
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:57,110
operators are used to build arguments.
