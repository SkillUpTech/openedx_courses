I'll get into that in a little bit.","But, underneath your Cosmos DB graph,","what's great is you still","get Turn-key global distribution.","You still get elastic storage and throughput,","you still get automatic indexing,","tunable consistency and comprehensive SLAs.",">> So, you were just talking about traversing,","graphing it, your edges and vertices.","That's a new concept to me.","So, do you have","an example that might help me understand that?",">> Sure. In the case of graphs,","a classic example is actually flights.","In other words, in this case the vertex is","your airport and the edge","is your flight between those airports.","So let's say I'm flying from San Francisco to Seattle,","the two cities airports are your vertexes","and the flight between those two cities is my edge.","So that's a classic example of your Graph model.",">> So, what you're saying to me is","if I want to get a faster flight,","my airport or airline","needs to upgrade their Graph database right?","That's right. If you want to use","a Graph database to ask some really interesting queries,","for example, like the shortest path","between San Francisco and Buffalo,","happens to be through Las Vegas actually.",">> Okay it's pretty exciting.",">> All right. So, what we","base the graph on is on Apache TinkerPop.","Okay. We have got a lot of really good features,","that we've already included as part of the preview.","These are the Graph features, variable features,","vertex, vertex properties, edge and edge properties.","The basic concept here is that the basic steps and","the basic traversals are already","included within the Graph preview of Cosmos DB.",">> So TinkerPop, that's like a standard?",">> That's correct. Actually a very good question.","TinkerPop is a open-source standard for Graph.","There are actually other standards,","but this seemed to be one of the more popular ones","so that's why we designed accordingly.",">> Okay great.",">> Yeah. And so,","for those who are interested in","the common Graph scenarios,","these include social networks,","recommendations, logistics and internet of things.","So, there's a lot of cool things that you can","solve using graph databases.",">> Okay. Definitely some scenarios","where I have to do applications in","that space and they're very tough to do","from traditional and nontraditional databases.","So, if this can solve","those problems, that's really exciting to me.",">> Exactly. Yes. And, we're going to come up and show","a quick demo of how to run","those TinkerPop Gremlin queries,","right from the screen shortly.",">> So again, all very exciting stuff","and I definitely want to learn more","about the Graph API and how we","can use it within Cosmos DB.",">> That's right."]}
