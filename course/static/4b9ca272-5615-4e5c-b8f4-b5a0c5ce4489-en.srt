00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:04,130
In previous lessons we were looking at argument form.

1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,220
Argument form is the structure of a logical argument

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:09,470
in which we place premises and

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:14,180
conclusions that are made up of statements and propositions.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:15,240
What we're gonna do in this lesson,

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,920
and in subsequent lessons,

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,760
is dive a little bit deeper into specific argument forms.

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:23,650
Specifically we're gonna look at deductive arguments and

8
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,415
inductive arguments and how you construct these.

9
00:00:26,415 --> 00:00:29,035
We talked a little bit about validity in a previous lesson.

10
00:00:29,035 --> 00:00:32,110
We're gonna go a little bit more deeper into those concepts.

11
00:00:32,110 --> 00:00:33,710
So, just to remind you,

12
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:36,410
we've already talked about propositions and

13
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,280
as we worked through the structure of arguments,

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,190
as we worked through the toolkit,

15
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:45,610
remember that it's propositions that are true or false.

16
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:47,050
If you need a reminder on this,

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,250
I would encourage you to go back to a previous lesson and

18
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,290
then just get a quick review on what propositions are.

19
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,790
But in our taxonomy, in our overall structure,

20
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:58,720
in our toolkit, remember that propositions are true and

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,260
false in logic, and that's going to be very important as we

22
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,829
work on constructing these arguments.

23
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:07,330
Now what I wanna do is talk about deductive syllogism.

24
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:10,230
I introduced the term syllogism in a previous lesson.

25
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:12,350
A syllogism is just an argument form,

26
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:13,975
a structure of an argument.

27
00:01:13,975 --> 00:01:18,996
Syllogisms have two premises and that's followed by a conclusion.

28
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:22,410
And we're gonna look at the form of argument called

29
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:24,130
deductive arguments.

30
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:28,010
Deductive arguments, simply put, are arguments where

31
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:33,070
if the premises are true, assuming the premises are true,

32
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:36,660
the conclusion must follow with logical necessity.

33
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:40,590
Or, to put differently, if the premises are true,

34
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:44,140
it's impossible that the conclusion is false.

35
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,923
That's what a deductive argument means.

36
00:01:46,923 --> 00:01:49,388
So when you're looking at deductive arguments,

37
00:01:49,388 --> 00:01:51,150
we're gonna look at validity in just a moment,

38
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,920
but when you're looking at deductive arguments,

39
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,380
you're gonna look at the form and you're gonna always assume,

40
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,410
in determining whether or not the argument is valid,

41
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:04,830
if the premises are true does the conclusion follow?

42
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,210
Now, notice you don't have to know whether

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,390
the premises are true

44
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:10,450
in order to determine whether the argument has a valid form.

45
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:12,665
You're just gonna ask yourself if they were true,

46
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:17,280
is it possible that the conclusion's false?

47
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,190
I say here that deductive arguments are the strongest type

48
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:23,950
of argument because it's impossible to for

49
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:26,980
the conclusion to be false given true premises.

50
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:32,290
Now, let's go back and revisit this notion of validity again.

51
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,490
If you'll recall from an earlier lesson,

52
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:38,880
validity only talks about the structure.

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,040
It talks about the relationship between the premises of

54
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,880
an argument and the conclusion of the argument.

55
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,740
It has nothing to do with whether or

56
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,840
not the premises are true or false.

57
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,010
So a deductive argument is constructed in such a way that,

58
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,900
again, if the premises are true, it is not possible for

59
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,979
the conclusion to be false.

60
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:05,725
That's the definition of a deductive argument.

61
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:09,839
It's not possible that the conclusion is false.

62
00:03:09,839 --> 00:03:15,310
As I said earlier, validity only applies to deductive arguments.

63
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:17,835
Validity only applies to deductive arguments.

64
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:22,590
So we can only tell whether the conclusion is necessary given

65
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:27,896
true premises if the argument is in deductive form.

66
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:31,770
So validity, again, has to do with the form of the argument

67
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:33,419
not with the truth value of the premises.

68
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,675
Let's look at a couple of arguments here.

69
00:03:37,675 --> 00:03:40,885
Suppose I make the claim, all shrews are nocturnal,

70
00:03:40,885 --> 00:03:41,750
premise one.

71
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,220
Premise two, all shrews are insectivores.

72
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,622
The conclusion therefore,

73
00:03:48,622 --> 00:03:52,332
at least some insectivores are nocturnal.

74
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,088
This is a valid argument form.

75
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:57,929
Now suppose you don't know what shrews are, or you don't know

76
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:01,220
the meaning of nocturnal, it doesn't really matter does it?

77
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,340
Because we can tell that this is a valid form

78
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,610
by looking at the structure.

79
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:07,600
We can say if it's true,

80
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,580
we don't know cuz we don't know the meaning of the terms, but

81
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:12,350
if it is true that all shrews are nocturnal, and

82
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,420
if it is true that all shrews are insectivores, then it's

83
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:20,130
absolutely certain that at least some insectivores are nocturnal.

84
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:23,939
We don't have to know what nocturnal and

85
00:04:23,939 --> 00:04:26,588
insectivores or shrews are to know that

86
00:04:26,588 --> 00:04:29,972
the conclusion follows with logical necessity.

87
00:04:29,972 --> 00:04:32,134
So that is a valid deductive argument and

88
00:04:32,134 --> 00:04:34,020
it's in a valid form.

89
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:37,111
As we learned earlier we can symbolize all of this.

90
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:42,270
We can put symbols in place of these actual terms.

91
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,340
So we can replace shrews with S, nocturnal with N,

92
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,160
insectivores with I.

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,430
And we can get our same argument structure, All S are N,

94
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,540
All S are I, therefore, at least some I are N.

95
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,660
This is a valid form.

96
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,790
And you can even see with just using symbols,

97
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,790
that if we assume the premises are true,

98
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,820
the conclusion must follow with logical necessity.

99
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:08,766
That's what a deductive argument does.

100
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,766
And we can determine that validity just based on

101
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:13,610
the structure.

102
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:15,490
So as you are looking at arguments,

103
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:19,127
as you are constructing them, as you're analyzing them, the first

104
00:05:19,127 --> 00:05:22,450
step in looking at a deductive argument is to determine whether

105
00:05:22,450 --> 00:05:24,981
or not the deductive argument is in valid form.

106
00:05:24,981 --> 00:05:26,150
That's the first step.

107
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:28,990
It doesn't mean that you've done everything you need to do, but

108
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:31,510
you at least need to do that part.

109
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,250
If the argument is not in valid form, then you can stop.

110
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,220
The analysis is over, you can say it's now a bad argument.

111
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:42,110
You don't need to really do any further analysis because it's

112
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:43,578
not in the right form.

113
00:05:43,578 --> 00:05:46,700
If it is in a valid form, then you're gonna want to go on

114
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:51,400
to the next step and take a look at

115
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:55,630
how the form actually relates to the truth value of the premises.

116
00:05:57,030 --> 00:05:59,940
So valid form is where the argument

117
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,460
is in the proper structure.

118
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,990
And then an invalid argument,

119
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:06,520
an invalid form, is where the conclusion

120
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,398
does not necessarily follow from the truth of the premises.

121
00:06:09,398 --> 00:06:14,290
Put another way, even if you assume the premises are true,

122
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,990
if its possible that the conclusion is false,

123
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,240
then the argument is invalid.

124
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,940
So let's look at this argument.

125
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,010
All in symbolic form,

126
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,500
we're not gonna put any terms in here just now.

127
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:30,120
Let's suppose we said all a are b, all a are c, therefore,

128
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,140
all b are c.

129
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,100
This is an invalid form because it could be true that

130
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,140
both of the premises are true but

131
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,510
it's also possible that the conclusion is false.

132
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:46,130
We cannot derive this conclusion from those premises.

133
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,140
It's possible for

134
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,440
the conclusion to be false, even given true premises.

135
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,160
If you're following along, you'll notice that there was one

136
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,240
minor change between this argument and

137
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,030
the argument we just looked at.

138
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,170
What is that change?

139
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,210
Well, we changed in the conclusion the sum to all and

140
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,580
that makes the argument invalid.

141
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,410
Just by changing that one word it makes the argument

142
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,350
invalid because this conclusion

143
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,900
does not follow with logical necessity from those premises.

144
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,506
Let's illustrate it by looking at it with actual terms in it.

145
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:21,583
All crayons are colored.

146
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:24,300
All crayons are pigmented.

147
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:27,340
Therefore, all colored things and pigmented things.

148
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,240
All right that is an invalid argument.

149
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,850
Now you might be saying but, wait Paul, hold on a second.

150
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:35,690
That conclusion is true.

151
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:36,550
Yes, it is, right?

152
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,110
Just assuming we're not gonna quibble with language,

153
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,920
all colored things are pigmented things.

154
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,440
So how come this is an invalid argument?

155
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,740
The reason it's invalid is because we cannot get this

156
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,150
conclusion from the premises I've given you.

157
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:53,160
From the premises all crayons are colored and

158
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,730
all crayons are pigmented, we cannot derive the conclusion

159
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,391
all colors things are pigmented things,

160
00:07:59,391 --> 00:08:01,860
even though that conclusion is true.

161
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,754
We don't get it from the premises.

162
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:04,495
In order for

163
00:08:04,495 --> 00:08:07,833
an argument to work the premises have to give us reason

164
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:11,940
to believe the conclusion is true and that's not true here.

165
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,180
It's still possible,

166
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,270
given our premises, that that conclusion is false.

167
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,940
Therefore, it's an invalid form.

168
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,870
So validity has to do with the structure of the argument.

169
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:25,940
Based on the possible truth of the premises,

170
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,480
it's impossible that the conclusion is false.

171
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,355
If it is possible that conclusion is false

172
00:08:30,355 --> 00:08:31,020
it's invalid.

173
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,230
If it's impossible the conclusion is false,

174
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,190
then it's valid.

175
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,980
And that's what validity has to do with in terms of

176
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,050
deductive arguments.
