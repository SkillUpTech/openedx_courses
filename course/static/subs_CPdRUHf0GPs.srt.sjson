So we have been very lucky in the sense that","customers have made a choice to","use the MongoDB app server.","And what we have done is since we enabled","this wide level compact,","so pretty much all the applications","that you can think of,","whether it is IoT applications,","whether it is the content management systems,","so CMS kind of systems,","or they could be basically systems like time CT systems,","which basically analyze the data","in a time CT fashion and so on and so forth.","Pretty much anything that can be represented as","a document and can be analyzed","and updated as other scenarios that can be","enabled under MongoDB API or the Cosmos DB.","The key part here is we are","leveraging the underlying Cosmos DB.","So this is the key part.","So many customers who come here ready for MongoDB are","the folks who want global distribution,","who want very low latency experience of reads and rights,","who want to put elasticity,","because it is very difficult to","do in regular VM based systems,","and they want availability guarantees.","So what is happening here is we are","leveraging the goodness of the Cosmos DB platform,","and we are in it.","We are basically supporting","whatever MongoDB does the best.","And I had to keep","the code base intact and the data intact.","So there is no migration for them in a big way.","That's what we enable. But you","can think of there are customers","who take data from a sensor and then store it.","All of that data goes into IoT.","There are customers who have evolved CMS systems,","they basically have a lot of metadata and they're stored","inside the MongoDB API and so on and so forth.","So there are a bunch of these customers who","utilize in various kinds of scenarios.",">> Now are there any customers who come to Cosmos DB with","a brand new application or brand","new scenario and jump straight to the MongoDB API?",">> Yeah definitely. So there are customers,","what they do is they","take an approach of saying that they want to let go","with MongoDB API because they want to make sure that","they can leverage MongoDB APIs on","our platform as well as their On Premises platform.","So this is something very unique","because now they can leverage","without worrying about a lot of","issues about moving from one place to another.","They can leverage MongoDB itself in both the places.","So in this way they are","pretty much platform independent from us.",">> So this is really interesting to me.","So as part of my developer background,","I can sit at my desk today and run MongoDB locally,","develop against it and then when we push the application","to Azure we're just pointing Azure Cosmos DB,","but the application doesn't care because","you're saying the wire support is from MongoDB?",">> Oh yes. So it works both ways.","You can start with MongoDB","itself or there is another concept that we have.","We have a concept called the emulator.","So this is our version of Cosmos DB on","our desktop which pretty much","supports the MongoDB as it is.","So either you can start here or you can start here.","So we support both the models,","but the idea key part here","is most of the customers who leverage","MongoDB are the folks who want","to keep their existing code base,","or want to develop","new code base with","specific focus on MongoDB capabilities.","There are some things which we don't support in","Cosmos DB's document API.","So they want to leverage those pieces.",">> Oh yeah definitely. With this MongoDB API","what's really exciting to me as a developer as","also somebody who's worked on","data side and Azure side to know","that if I onboard people into","my team who are comfortable in MongoDB,","that they can hit the ground running on day one,","that MongoDB is part of our stack today,","that we just have one-on-one support,","like you said wire support in","the cloud and our applications that just completely,","our application's portable at","that point, that's what it sounds like.","That's basically our endeavor.","Our endeavor is to be where the developers are so that","they don't have to do heavy work later on.",">> Yeah that sounds perfect to me."]}
