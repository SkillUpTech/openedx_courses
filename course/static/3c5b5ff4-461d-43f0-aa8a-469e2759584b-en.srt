00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:03,526
In this lesson, we're going to be looking at arguments.

1
00:00:03,526 --> 00:00:05,306
As I said in a previous lesson,

2
00:00:05,306 --> 00:00:08,600
logic is the science of studying something.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,350
Like any science, there is an object of study, and

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,200
in logic what we study is arguments.

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,045
So we're gonna walk through what an argument is and

6
00:00:16,045 --> 00:00:17,963
this is gonna be the focal point for

7
00:00:17,963 --> 00:00:21,240
developing sound reasoning through logic.

8
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,940
So let me talk to you about what a logical argument is.

9
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,028
When you think of the word argument, sometimes you think of

10
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:29,805
a bunch of angry people, or two or more angry people,

11
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:32,338
in a conversation kinda yelling at each other and

12
00:00:32,338 --> 00:00:34,166
getting on each other's nerves.

13
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,170
A logical argument obviously is not that.

14
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,043
The formal definition of an argument is to offer a reason or

15
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:44,530
a set of reasons to get somebody to believe something.

16
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:47,586
So the goal of an argument is to convince or change somebody's

17
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:50,369
mind, that's really what we're talking about here.

18
00:00:50,369 --> 00:00:54,748
So, a logical argument then consists of three main things.

19
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:56,588
And you're gonna see two in bold here, but

20
00:00:56,588 --> 00:00:58,285
there's actually three components.

21
00:00:58,285 --> 00:01:01,581
So the argument consists of something that you're offering,

22
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:03,430
a reason or a set of reasons.

23
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,197
And these reasons are called premises and

24
00:01:06,197 --> 00:01:10,149
they lead to another idea, another thing that you wanna get

25
00:01:10,149 --> 00:01:14,352
somebody to believe, which is called the conclusion, okay?

26
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:17,862
So the premises lead to the conclusion and that lead to or

27
00:01:17,862 --> 00:01:21,370
as you see in the slide here, the offered in support of,

28
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,950
is the third component of a logical argument.

29
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,170
So the premises should provide reasons to believe

30
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,270
that the conclusion is true.

31
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:34,540
The premises should provide reasons to believe

32
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,400
that the conclusion is true.

33
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,960
Now why is this third component,

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,370
this offered in support of, important?

35
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,420
Well, if you think about something that might be

36
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,770
structured like an argument,

37
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:49,720
not everything that's structured like an argument

38
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,690
gives you reason to believe that something is true.

39
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,140
So if I said, the sun will rise tomorrow morning,

40
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:00,730
Britney Spears is a famous pop star, therefore, grass is green.

41
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,390
It sounds sorta like an argument, right?

42
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:05,540
I'm giving you premises and then I'm saying therefore something

43
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:08,560
is true, but there's no logical relation.

44
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,890
That's why this logical relation, this third component,

45
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:12,150
is so important.

46
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,080
The premises have to give you a reason to believe

47
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,970
that the conclusion is true.

48
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,420
The main focal point of arguments though,

49
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,470
is this conclusion.

50
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,090
This is the thing you want the person to walk away with and

51
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:25,460
say yes, I think that's true now.

52
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,730
So your premises have to be strong enough to

53
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:32,450
convince the person that the conclusion is true.

54
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:34,290
And this is really all there is to an argument,

55
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,550
to a logical argument.

56
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:37,830
As long as you have those three components,

57
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:40,630
then you're constructing the argument in the right way.

58
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:42,262
Now as we move throughout the course,

59
00:02:42,262 --> 00:02:43,796
you're gonna see how this is done.

60
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:47,115
I'm gonna show you and give you the tools to do this in

61
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:50,667
the right way and to do this in a way that's convincing.

62
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,210
Some arguments are strong, some arguments are weak.

63
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,663
You can build good arguments and poor arguments.

64
00:02:55,663 --> 00:02:59,150
What I'm gonna do in this course is show you how to construct

65
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:02,170
good arguments using exactly this format.

66
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:04,782
And that's what we'll start to do in the next few lessons.
