I'm starting to understand vertices and","edges and I'm really","interested in them. How do I create them?","How do I do","this basic CRUD stuff of vertices and edges: create them,","get one, update it deleted it,","all the stuff I do with a relational database.","How do I do this in this whole graph world?",">>You've got it. Let's go right into it.","So let's do a quick primer on graph structures.","In this case, they're comprised of","vertices and edges, just like you noted.","The edges denote relationships between those vertices.","The properties express information","about those vertices and","edges and so when you combine this","together is a concept known as property graphs,","which is what Cosmos DB is because we're","using the tinker-pop specification.",">>And you're just saying edges","denote the relationship between vertices.","So does that mean to create","an edge I must have an existing vertex?",">>That's a excellent question and that's exactly right.","So unless you have two vertices in place,","you can't actually have an edge","which relates those two vertices.","So let's dive into the next demo.","So right here we're going to start with our demo","on CRUD using gremlin in.NET.",">>Let's start off by building","a.NET application using the Graph API.","This handy page will provide you","all the instructions for you to spin up","a graph collection within Cosmos DB,","plus also accessing the Azure portal","and the.NET code samples we're about to show.","Within the graph portal you'll notice that if I go ahead","and go through the data explore under the test graph DB,","I have a graph called sample.","Right now there's no data in it,","so let's go ahead and work","with.NET to insert vertices into it.","I'll start off by uncommenting","this code and then","I'm going to go ahead and run the code base.","So when I click start here,","what it'll do is it'll run","five separate gremlin statements","and you'll see the output right here.","These gremlin statements are","your standard tinker-pop gremlin graph statements.","Now that it's up and running, if I go back to","my graph and I go ahead and click on Apply Filter,","you'll notice that this is great.","I've got the different vertices in this case: Thomas,","Mary, Ben and Robin","and their various different properties.","Like in this case Mary,","she's a person with a first name of Mary,","last name of Anderson,","age 39, user id of two.","That's great but it's not very useful.","So that's the other important","concept that we want to show.","Let's add some edges,","which shows relationships between the vertices,","in this case that different people.","So let's go back to our code.","So let's go ahead and","uncomment these three other edge statements.","And we're going to rerun the code again,","in this case we're going to clean up,","rerun the same vertices statements and","also rerun these new edge statements.","Now that it's done let's go back to the portal.","I can go ahead and click on","Apply Filter again and there we go.","Now we can see the relationships.","So in this case Ben and","Thomas and Mary are related in this way.","In other words Ben is a friend of Thomas,","actually I'll zoom in till you","see it a little bit better,","Ben is a friend of Thomas or Thomas is","a friend of Mary and Ben has","some additional relationships as well.","So this is a quick and fast way for you to explore,","the graph explorer directly by using.NET to enter in","your vertices and your edges and using","the Azure portal to look at the data.","So go ahead and play with","the additional code that's included within the.NET sample","so you can see how gremlin interacts with","Cosmos DB to create your Cosmos DB gremlin graph."]}
