In this video,","we'll talk about comparing MongoDB to","Azure Cosmos DB within MongoDB API.","For some context, Azure Cosmos DB","is equally redistributed,","multi-tenant, scalable databases service.","There are also features that differentiate","between Cosmos DB, MongoDB API,","and native MongoDB which uniquely","positions Cosmos DB within the database industry.","For this video, we'll closely walk through","the Azure portals to showcase a lot of these features,","and to talk about the differences between","the Cosmos DB MongoDB API and MongoDB.","As you can see here,","I already have a database created, titled anho-mongo.","And one of the first things you do notice is that","we do support turn key global distribution.","With a couple of clicks within the Azure portal,","you are able to replicate your database to","any number of Azure regions.","You can also choose that Automatic Failovers if","your primary works ever have a disaster scenario.","Something else we support is that we","have elasticity in terms","of throughput as well as storage.","So, if I go to the scale,","you'll find that I can set the throughput","for collection anywhere","between 400 to any number RUs are required.","Even when you exceed 10,000 RU/s,","I merely discharge my collection.","Something else you might have noticed is that","we scale storage and throughput independently.","And so, if you were to scale up throughput,","for more bits and bytes,","you don't necessarily have to scale up storage.","And if you have a application","that requires a lot of storage,","but not too much throughput,","then you can scale up storage independently as well.","So, the common segue from here is what is an RU/s?","Well, Azure Cosmos DB is a multi-tenant service.","As multi-tenant service, we do","have strong resource governance to make","sure that one neighbor can","affect the behavior of another.","How do we make sure that we have","strong resource governance?","We actually do a normalized unit of","currency for the amount of IOPS,","memory, and CPU used,","which we combine into RU/s.","With RU/s, we can dictate","exactly how much throughput each user gets,","and we can make sure that there is","no intervals we didn't perform within Azure Cosmos DB.","With RU/s coming in as","a new concept into most MongoDB applications,","we've introduced a new command where you can","actually determine how many RUs an application takes.","So, if I were to open up my command prompt,","and head over to Quick start with a new portal,","I can connect into my database.","Within the database, I can go to my edx database,","and then, I can run a simple query,","as such, that will turn me to","ten documents within my edx collection.","So, I would like to know","exactly how many RUs this query took?","Well, I can do a simple command,","db.query.runCommand({getLastRequestStatistics:1}),","and this will return exactly how many RUs","my last request has taken.","As you can see, the operation is a query and you","took about 5.46 RUs to","complete this operation to return ten documents.","Another difference between MongoDB","and Azure CosmosDB with","the MongoDB API is","that we support metric within our Azure portal.","So, if I were to go over to their metrics thing,","you'll find that we support a suited","metrics for you to determine","exactly how many RUs you're taking.","If you are receiving any throttling,","which means that you're consuming","more throughput than what you've allocated for,","exactly what your request charges were,","what was the max, what is","the max consumed to RU/s per physical partition,","and you can have metrics","for storage, availability, latency,","consistency, and you can","have it across any times, when you wish.","Just one hour, 24 hours,","seven days and custom.","Something else that makes this unique","reposition is we do support ARM templates.","And so, if you choose to use ARM templates","for Azure's CLI's to automate your deployments,","you can do so by coming through the automation script.","And lastly, one of the biggest differentiators","for Azure Cosmos DB","versus need of MongoDB is","that we do support automatic indexing.","As you put in your documents into Cosmos DB,","we do automatically index your properties,","and we do remove a lot of index management.","If you choose to do crop indexes or create indexes,","we do allow you to have the option of doing so as well.","And there are a number of power users who decide","that they want to do their own custom indexing policy,","and take advantage of this as well."]}
