Hi, and welcome to Logic and Computational Thinking.

1
00:00:09,227 --> 00:00:12,220
I'm so glad that you were able to join us for this course.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,150
My name is Paul Pardi, I have been at Microsoft for

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:20,118
about 20 years and programming computers since I was about 12.

4
00:00:20,118 --> 00:00:22,330
I'm not gonna tell you how old I am now, but

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,900
it's been a long time.

6
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:27,519
In addition to working for Microsoft, I teach at a local

7
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,909
university here in Seattle and I teach philosophy.

8
00:00:30,909 --> 00:00:34,321
So these subjects really are a part of the things that I do on

9
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:36,280
a daily basis and I really enjoy.

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,515
In this course,

11
00:00:38,515 --> 00:00:42,082
we're gonna learn the fundamentals of formal logic.

12
00:00:42,082 --> 00:00:44,764
I'm gonna teach you what logic is all about,

13
00:00:44,764 --> 00:00:48,648
how to think logically, and then how to apply logical principles

14
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:52,380
to problems that you may encounter each and every day.

15
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,340
So you're going to learn life skills in some important

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,780
way in this course.

17
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,615
But we're also going to apply the things that we learn in

18
00:01:00,615 --> 00:01:03,630
formal logic to computer science.

19
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,890
As you may know, computers are very logical machines,

20
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,570
they operate on a logical model.

21
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:11,210
So there's a very close relationship to

22
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,950
the way that you can think logically and

23
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:15,800
then apply that to writing computer programs.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,813
So the main premise of this course is that by thinking

25
00:01:18,813 --> 00:01:21,962
logically, by learning how to think more logically,

26
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:25,322
you're gonna be able to write better computer programs.

27
00:01:25,322 --> 00:01:27,140
And that's what we're gonna do in this course.

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,940
We're also gonna touch on the subject of critical thinking.

29
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,150
Critical thinking is the ability to ask the right questions at

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,710
the right time, to ask questions that no

31
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:39,560
one else is thinking about, and then to apply the answers to

32
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,670
those questions to the problems that you're trying to solve.

33
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:43,864
So we're gonna touch on that as well in this course.

34
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:47,823
And you'll see how that topic applies to computer science

35
00:01:47,823 --> 00:01:49,110
as well.

36
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:51,411
So again, I'm really pleased that you're here.

37
00:01:51,411 --> 00:01:54,987
Settle in, enjoy the topic, and I'll look forward to working

38
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:57,290
with you as we work through this course.
