0
00:00:00,711 --> 00:00:02,700
We've been looking at argument forms.

1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,310
Argument forms are the structure

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,800
that we use to construct logical arguments.

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,863
In a previous lesson we looked at deductive arguments,

4
00:00:10,863 --> 00:00:13,338
the concept of validity and invalidity, and

5
00:00:13,338 --> 00:00:14,783
the notion of soundness.

6
00:00:14,783 --> 00:00:17,672
Which is what we really want when we're constructing

7
00:00:17,672 --> 00:00:19,300
deductive arguments.

8
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,110
Now we're gonna switch a little bit to look at a different

9
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,030
argument form, or

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:26,100
different argument structure, called inductive arguments.

11
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:30,760
Inductive arguments are not arguments of impossibility and

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,560
necessity, as we saw with deductive arguments, but

13
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:35,140
arguments of probability.

14
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,170
So these types of arguments,

15
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,340
if we assume that the premises are true.

16
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:43,040
All we can say

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,450
about the conclusion is that the conclusion is likely to be true,

18
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:50,030
not that it actually is true, it's likely to be true.

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,347
It's possible on inductive arguments,

20
00:00:52,347 --> 00:00:55,865
given true premises that the conclusion still could be false.

21
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:57,634
Now inductive arguments are arguments we use all

22
00:00:57,634 --> 00:00:58,333
the time, right?

23
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:01,342
These are when you're talking about what a person might like

24
00:01:01,342 --> 00:01:03,820
or not like, what's gonna happen in the future,

25
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,000
those types of things.

26
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,630
Even certain scientific claims are inductive in nature,

27
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,390
because we cannot guarantee the truth of the conclusion even

28
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:15,330
though the premises are true, all right?

29
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,687
In inductive arguments as opposed to deductive arguments,

30
00:01:18,687 --> 00:01:21,260
we talk about strength rather than validity.

31
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:24,070
All right, we talk about strength rather than validity.

32
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:27,180
Inductive arguments are all about the content

33
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:31,000
of the premises rather than the structure of the argument.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
So in inductive arguments,

35
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,720
we can't tell anything by the structure.

36
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,629
In fact, the structure doesn't give us any indication

37
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:42,537
of the relationship of the premises to the conclusion,

38
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,616
other than the conclusion and

39
00:01:44,616 --> 00:01:48,960
the premises being in the right relationships to each other.

40
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,350
But we can't tell anything about whether the argument is good or

41
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,233
bad solely based on the structure,

42
00:01:54,233 --> 00:01:56,600
we have to see the content.

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,480
Okay, so inductive arguments then are strong or weak.

44
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,810
Again, the conclusion probably follows from the premises

45
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,350
given the fact that the premises are true.

46
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:09,560
Again, if we don't know whether the premises are true or false,

47
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,470
we assume they're true to see how probabilistic

48
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,900
the conclusion is.

49
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,490
And if the conclusion is likely to be false,

50
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:18,910
based on the truth of the premises,

51
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,690
we say the inductive argument is weak, all right?

52
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,540
So in inductive arguments we're talking about strength and

53
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,100
weakness, rather than valid or invalid.

54
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,194
You can only make a claim of strength or

55
00:02:30,194 --> 00:02:33,471
weakness when we're talking about inductive arguments.

56
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:34,840
All right, so here's some examples.

57
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,320
These are obvious examples, but that's the point.

58
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,860
I wanna make the point clear to you by just giving you these

59
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:43,160
obvious examples.

60
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,430
This is a weak argument, a weak inductive argument.

61
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,870
This barrel contains one hundred apples.

62
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:50,750
Three apples selected at random were found to be ripe.

63
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:54,130
Therefore probably all one hundred apples are ripe.

64
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,720
Now it's possibly true that the conclusion is true,

65
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:00,820
it's possible that that's correct, but

66
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,000
we don't have enough data in premise two to

67
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,060
give us good reason to believe that that conclusion is true.

68
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,360
So the conclusion is only possibly true, we

69
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:13,510
wouldn't say it's probably true, so it's an inductive argument.

70
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:15,641
But it's a weak inductive argument,

71
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,445
there's just not enough samples in premise two.

72
00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:21,435
All right, we can strengthen this up by just increasing

73
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,850
the sample size, right?

74
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,345
So in premise two now I say,

75
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:27,525
eighty apples selected at random were found to be ripe.

76
00:03:27,525 --> 00:03:30,119
That now gives us a stronger reason to believe that

77
00:03:30,119 --> 00:03:33,391
the conclusion is true, and in this inductive argument I would

78
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:35,490
say that the argument is in fact strong,

79
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:38,539
because we have increased the sample size in premise two.

80
00:03:38,539 --> 00:03:39,435
All right, so

81
00:03:39,435 --> 00:03:42,950
just by changing the number of apples we've reviewed,

82
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,929
we can go from a weak argument to a strong argument, all right?

83
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:49,330
I ask this question here, are strong arguments valid?

84
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:53,080
No, because validity has nothing to do with inductive arguments.

85
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,173
So when you're looking at an argument,

86
00:03:55,173 --> 00:03:58,253
if you wanna tell whether or not the argument is inductive or

87
00:03:58,253 --> 00:04:01,087
deductive, you have to ask yourself the question does

88
00:04:01,087 --> 00:04:04,250
the conclusion follow with probability or with necessity?

89
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,670
Assuming the truth of the premises.

90
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,696
If the conclusion falls with probability,

91
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:10,677
you are looking at an inductive argument.

92
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:13,966
If the conclusion follows with necessity, assuming the truth of

93
00:04:13,966 --> 00:04:17,016
the premises, then you're looking at a deductive argument

94
00:04:17,016 --> 00:04:19,912
and you wanna check for validity and invalidity, okay?

95
00:04:19,912 --> 00:04:22,722
Now we're looking at strength and weakness,

96
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:26,600
what if we wanna check for the truth value of the premises?

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,918
What does that give us in terms of inductive arguments?

98
00:04:28,918 --> 00:04:31,110
Well that's the next concept here.

99
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:34,020
So just like we had soundness in deductive arguments,

100
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,190
in inductive arguments, we have what's called cogency.

101
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:41,080
This is where we have a strong inductive argument

102
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,700
that also has true premises.

103
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:48,020
Strong inductive argument that has true premises.

104
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:49,810
So let's take this argument.

105
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:50,880
This is strong,

106
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,240
but it's uncogent, because it has a false premise.

107
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,940
All meteorites found to this day have contained gold.

108
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,790
Conclusion, therefore probably the next

109
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:04,750
meteorite will contain gold, right?

110
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:08,850
It's a strong argument in terms of the relationship of

111
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,210
the conclusion to the premise that we have here.

112
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:16,713
But because the first premise is false, it's not true that all

113
00:05:16,713 --> 00:05:19,556
meteorites found to this day have contained gold,

114
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:22,415
we would say that the argument is uncogent, okay.

115
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:24,401
But you can still see why it would be strong,

116
00:05:24,401 --> 00:05:27,030
assuming the truth of the first premise.

117
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:28,780
Let's suppose we didn't know,

118
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,720
we can only evaluate that as a strong argument.

119
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,530
Once we learn the truth of the first premise,

120
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,730
then we can call it uncogent cuz we know it's false, okay?

121
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,942
So, as we're looking at our taxonomy here,

122
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,958
as at our tool kit, we have propositions true or false.

123
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,373
Deductive arguments are valid or invalid,

124
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:49,592
deductive arguments can also be sound or

125
00:05:49,592 --> 00:05:52,347
unsound based on the truth value of the premises.

126
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:54,450
And now we have inductive arguments.

127
00:05:54,450 --> 00:05:56,330
Inductive arguments can be strong or weak,

128
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,300
inductive arguments also can be cogent or uncogent based on

129
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,350
the truth value of the premises and inductive arguments.

130
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:07,970
So now we have a really strong tool kit here.

131
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:11,100
We're developing a really tight tool kit for

132
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,490
constructing logical arguments, you've got your premises,

133
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:18,240
statements, operators, symbolization.

134
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,610
We've looked at argument forms now, deductive and

135
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,890
inductive arguments, and you can now use these tools

136
00:06:23,890 --> 00:06:27,220
to not only construct arguments, but also to analyze.

137
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,210
In anything you're reading, if someone is making an argument,

138
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:33,450
you can start to pull those arguments apart to look

139
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:38,030
at its different components, and then do a better analytic job.

140
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,870
I'm also hoping that you're starting to see some of

141
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,410
the relationships between what we're studying in formal logic,

142
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,660
in terms of natural language and

143
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,120
applying those concepts to what we do in computer science.

144
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,270
If you're a computer programmer,

145
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,350
if you ever programmed, written a computer program itself.

146
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,500
You're gonna see some of these concepts starting to

147
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:59,810
come through as you're constructing those programs.

148
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,650
And we'll do more of this as we get into the rest of the course.
