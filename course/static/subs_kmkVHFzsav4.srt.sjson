Why should I care?","How is it different from some of the other APIs?","And, how does it fit into","the entire Azure CosmosDB story?",">> Yeah. So, this is, as you've seen,","that we first we enabled","on CosmosDB platform, that is a platform,","the CosmosDB platform which provides","the replication which provides","the low latency experience which provides","the auto indexing which","provides the availability and so on and so forth.","On top of it, we basically enable different shapes.","So, one of the shape is a document.","For document, one API that we enabled was DocumentDB API.","The second API that we enabled was the MongoDB API.","And then, you saw that we enabled this year,","Key Value API which","has Table as a manifestation as of today.","And then, we enabled Graph as one of the APIs which","has Gremlin as one of the manifestation for the query.","So, our endeavor, as you might have seen,","is to meet where the developers are.","Now, why this Table right?","Now, Table is a very successful platform for Microsoft.","It has been there right from the beginning.","It scales out pretty well for a large amount of data.","But then, there are things that customers keep on asking.","Few of them are basically","what customers keep on asking, is secondary indexing.","So, everybody says I want second indexing.","Now, customers come in and say that, hey,","can I actually do elastic throughput.","So tens and thousands","of requests per second is good but I want to","really go up to millions of requests per second.","Or, I want to go global distribution because there is","a good amount of distribution","to region distribution today.","But customers really want to","distribute across multiple locations, right?",">> Right.",">> Or, then customers come in,","I want to put my own index and so on and so forth.","So, what we did is we analyzed what","the Table storage provide and we saw that there","are a lot of things that CosmosDB","platform does out of the box.","So, how do we enable the Table API on CosmosDB platform?","So, what we did is we listened to all these","asks saying how do we enable all these?","These are all provided by us today.","And, we basically enabled the Table API as","a premium feature so","that customers who want to use these,","need these, can start using them.",">> So, yeah, this is really exciting interesting to me.","I'm going to zoom in on the Table API.","Secondary indexing, custom indexes, global distribution.",">> Yes.",">> A lot of stuff is","stuff I've always wanted in storage Table.",">> Sure.",">> I've seen it here.",">> Yes.",">> And, so, my next question would be,","I have these applications.","I have already implemented them","using Azure storage Tables.","How hard would it be for me to switch to Table API?",">> That's a great question too.","So, just like as we discussed in","the MongoDB API and other API connotation.","So, what we have done is, there is a drop","for Azure Table storage SDK.","And, we have updated it with our bits.","So, what customers can do is,","customers can connect to a standard Azure storage.","I should say storage because","otherwise I'll confuse it with the SAS.",">> SAS circuit.",">> So, you can connect the same,","use the same as we can connect to SAS,","Standard Azure Storage, and you can also connect with","a premium experience of the Table API.","And, this is very important because","then you can evolve your application as you go.","And, more importantly, you can use the same SDK","to connect to both end points without any code change.","So, the idea here is","the only code change which is required","is that you need","to go ahead and change the connection string.",">> Right.",">> Just like the other pieces.","There are a few more other pieces if you","want to change because if you want to get,","let's say put an indexing,","we have a way to put an index.","If you want to provide","Read and Write regents in certain way,","we have a way to provide all those things.","Things which are not available here,","we can provide most of those things","as config settings and just move forward.",">> See that's really exciting.","So, I can just go, let's say I have","a dotnet application today,","go in a new gate, pull my package version to the latest.",">> Yes.",">> And now I have access to","connecting to storage accounts","or to the premium experience with CosmosDB.",">> Yes.",">> And then, essentially just not","make a lot of changes to my existing application right?",">> That is the idea.

So, again,","with the Tables API I can just take","existing code that we already used with","a rock solid platform and take advantage of a lot of","new features right away with very little changes.",">> That's the key idea.
