0
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:02,990
So we've been looking at deductive arguments and

1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:04,560
constructing deductive arguments.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,710
Deductive arguments are arguments where,

3
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:10,110
given the truth of the premises, the conclusion must follow.

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,048
We looked at validity as an important concept in that

5
00:00:13,048 --> 00:00:13,590
notion.

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,333
If the conclusion does follow from the premises,

7
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,648
the argument is valid.

8
00:00:17,648 --> 00:00:21,587
If not, then the argument is invalid.

9
00:00:21,587 --> 00:00:24,242
But that's not all we wanna do when we're looking at deductive

10
00:00:24,242 --> 00:00:25,190
arguments.

11
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,780
Once we know that the argument is in the right structure

12
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,470
we still have to look at whether the premises are true or not.

13
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,200
We still wanna do that next investigative tasks.

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,300
So once we understand the structure of the argument

15
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:38,980
then we have to actually look at the premises themselves

16
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:40,640
to see whether they're true, and

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,260
that gives us our concept of soundness.

18
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:45,830
So really in a deductive argument what you're after is

19
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:48,780
a sound argument, not merely a valid one.

20
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,950
Validity is only the first step in constructing good deductive

21
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,010
arguments.

22
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,790
So let's take an argument that we looked at earlier.

23
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:59,240
We're gonna use the same

24
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:03,090
general terms that we used in an earlier arguments, but

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,200
we're gonna put it in a little bit of a different format here.

26
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,793
This argument I'm gonna say is valid.

27
00:01:08,793 --> 00:01:10,756
And we'll look at the structure in a moment.

28
00:01:10,756 --> 00:01:12,908
And then it also has true premises so

29
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:14,427
it's a sound argument.

30
00:01:14,427 --> 00:01:16,791
All crayons are colored.

31
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:19,852
All colored things are pigmented things.

32
00:01:19,852 --> 00:01:23,804
Therefore all crayons are pigmented things.

33
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:25,146
We can look at the structure.

34
00:01:25,146 --> 00:01:28,812
We can say it is impossible, given these two premises,

35
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:30,845
that the conclusion is false.

36
00:01:30,845 --> 00:01:33,519
Therefore, it's a valid form.

37
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:36,843
But we also can look at the premises themselves and

38
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:39,225
say yes, those are true premises.

39
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,280
The premises themselves are true.

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,262
Now notice I don't have to analyze the conclusion to see

41
00:01:46,262 --> 00:01:48,702
if the conclusion is true.

42
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:51,800
Because our definition of a deductive argument says,

43
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,247
if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.

44
00:01:55,247 --> 00:01:57,371
It's impossible for it not to be true.

45
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:59,474
If it's a valid deductive argument and

46
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:02,416
you have true premises, the conclusion must follow.

47
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:05,485
So given the fact that it's a valid form, given the fact

48
00:02:05,485 --> 00:02:09,630
that the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.

49
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,410
Now notice if you were listening to this argument,

50
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,820
if you agreed with the premises,

51
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,490
then you'd have to also agree with the conclusion.

52
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:20,200
It's not possible for you to be rational and

53
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:23,240
disagree with the conclusion if you agree with the premises.

54
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,040
And so you would then buy or

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,370
accept or take my argument as true.

56
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:31,160
And what I've just done is convinced you

57
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,400
of this conclusion by giving you true premises in a valid form.

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,410
That's what arguments are designed to do.

59
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:39,250
And now you're thinking logically.

60
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,410
You're accepting the truth of the premises and

61
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:45,110
then you actually learn something new.

62
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:47,670
You learn that all crayons are pigmented things

63
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,270
based on this valid deductive argument.

64
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,757
So if the argument's valid, if the argument has true premises

65
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,125
then we say it's a sound argument.

66
00:02:57,125 --> 00:03:00,408
All right, let's look at where we are in terms of our taxonomy

67
00:03:00,408 --> 00:03:01,300
in our toolkit.

68
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,913
We've learned that propositions are true or false.

69
00:03:06,913 --> 00:03:08,777
We've learned that in an earlier lesson.

70
00:03:08,777 --> 00:03:12,546
And now we've added this concept of deductive argument forms,

71
00:03:12,546 --> 00:03:16,526
which leverages propositions, the truth value of propositions,

72
00:03:16,526 --> 00:03:18,846
when we're talking about soundness.

73
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:20,645
So we have deductive arguments,

74
00:03:20,645 --> 00:03:23,550
deductive arguments can be either valid or invalid.

75
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:26,659
All invalid arguments are automatically unsound.

76
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:30,091
So you don't need to do any further investigation if you

77
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:32,580
know you have an invalid argument form.

78
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,519
If you do have a valid argument form,

79
00:03:34,519 --> 00:03:37,280
you'll wanna check whether the premises are true.

80
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,555
If the premises are true, the argument is sound.

81
00:03:39,555 --> 00:03:43,697
If the premises are false, then you have an unsound argument.

82
00:03:43,697 --> 00:03:46,587
So just because you have a valid argument doesn't mean you have

83
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:47,131
a good one,

84
00:03:47,131 --> 00:03:49,706
you still have to check the truth value of the premises.

85
00:03:49,706 --> 00:03:52,782
And if they are true, then you have a sound argument.

86
00:03:52,782 --> 00:03:55,555
So now you have the basic structure of a deductive

87
00:03:55,555 --> 00:03:59,142
argument and you can construct these deductive arguments once

88
00:03:59,142 --> 00:04:00,846
you know the argument forms.

89
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:05,647
And if you have true premises, you can plug them in and

90
00:04:05,647 --> 00:04:08,004
create sound arguments.

91
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:11,062
This is again only one form of argument and in a subsequent

92
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:13,929
lesson we're gonna look at what are called inductive

93
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:17,003
arguments and these are gonna be a little bit different.

94
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:18,439
They're structured similarly,

95
00:04:18,439 --> 00:04:20,962
but they're gonna have a very different, we're gonna take

96
00:04:20,962 --> 00:04:23,249
a very different approach when we put these together.
