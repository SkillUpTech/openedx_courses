So Andrew, I'm curious","DocumentDB API sounds really promising.","What are some of the scenarios,","a real world scenarios or","business scenarios where I would think about using","DocumentDB or maybe other people have seen success with","DocumentDB as the API of choice when using Cosmos DB?","So I'm going to go ahead and","give you the white board here.",">> Sure.","So I'll give you kind of","some of the patterns that I have observed over","time in terms of just interacting with","our users and seeing how they're using Cosmos DB,","just from my personal experience.","By no means is this comprehensive,","but just going to give you an idea of how are people","using the DocumentDB API today.","A lot of our users,","like there's three big areas where","we see a lot of usage for the DocumentDB API,","and the patterns I'm seeing are IoT, retail and gaming.","And in each of these different industries,","they have a set of business requirements that tends to","naturally draw them into","Cosmos DB as well as into the DocumentDB API.","In IoT, we have customers like Toyota,","and what they are doing is they're collecting a lot of","vehicle telemetry to be able to build services,","so that, let's say,","if a service engine light comes on,","they can immediately start prepping one of","their service centers and say, \"Hey, Mr. Driver.","Don't worry about that light.","Just come on and we'll take care of yo.","And also, we can also give you, let's say,","a monthly vehicle health reports.\"","They can also do things like, \"Hey,","if you get into a car accident,\" they are immediately","being notified and they'll actually","call and make sure and check up on you and say,","\"Hey, Mr. Driver, are you okay?\"","And if you don't pick up the phone then,","because they also get some telemetry on where you are,","they can immediately call","emergency services and get you some help right away.","So that way you're not just","left hanging somewhere in a bad state.",">> Oh yes, that's like a smart vehicle.",">> Now, in terms of why Cosmos DB for IoT?","Really, it comes down to a couple of things.","Number one is the amount of throughput that they need.","So if you think about most user applications,","I might only generate a few data points per day.","Like if I were voting on social media applications,","the number of times I actually comment per","day is going to be maybe less than 10.","If I'm a power user, maybe some number less than a 100.","Whereas for an IoT scenario,","devices can actually dump their state quite often.","They can go, \"Here's my state. Here's my state.","Here's my state. Here's my state.\"","And what I wanted to do is capture all of","that state to be able to do analytics on","top of that or power services","like preventative maintenance,","health reports, et cetera.","Because you want to capture all of","these full fidelity events,","you need something that supports very,","very high right ingestion,","and this is why Cosmos DB becomes a natural fit.","That's number one. Number two is","the flexible schema support of Cosmos DB.","And this is because, if you think about it,","let's say, in Toyota's case,","every model of car and each generation of model,","well actually, they will be","continuously improving the hardware on it.","Now, it's very difficult in contrast to","software to just click a button and deploy update.","So what ends up happening is as you improve the hardware","and having this high cost of","upgrading the old existing hardware,","naturally, what happens is","the schema and the amount of telemetry,","what you can capture is going to diverge.","And so having something that can ingest the schema","without knowing upfront and then","automatically index and provide","courier ability over that,","this is what a Cosmos DB is","and the DocumentDB API a natural fit.","For retail, we've seen people use that anywhere from","doing product catalogs to","powering real-time personalization services","to controlling an entire ordering pipeline.","And in fact, this is how some of","our customers like asus.com are","using Cosmos DB and the DocumentDB API.","Some of the challenges for","a product catalog is let's say, for example,","I have a vast catalog where","I sell everything under the sun,","from a mobile phone to a pen.","And for a pen, I might want to say what color it is,","how much does it weigh,","and I might add those as attributes.","Rather than going through the old school way of saying,","here's a product and I'm going to define, let's say,","columns for each attribute and which I","have to have a very rigid schema or have a set of,","let's say, attributes where","are then joined back to a product.","This is the old school relational way of thinking.","The problem with this approach is as you go","to large scale scenarios where you need to,","let's say, partition and scale out a database,","doing joins over a set of database shards becomes, well,","you'd never want to do a join over","across a network to other database shards.","This becomes where you take a huge performance hit.","And so rather than doing this approach,","what you can do is you can actually embed properties,","and really schema never went away.","And rather than defining a schema at a table level,","what the DocumentDB API allows you to do is","define schema at an individual record level.","And so if I'm selling something, let's say, a pen,","and my item is a surface pen,","I can even vary","like even though the type of this is a pen, surface pen.","Even though this is a type pen,","I might actually have other fields that","are only very specific to this.","I might have let's say Bluetooth","and the type of Bluetooth radio.","Whereas, if I have a sharpie or a dry erase marker,","it might not make sense for me to just","broadly blanket and say every pen now has Bluetooth.",">> And since this is just JSON,","I imagine most web frameworks could just","parse this and build like a HTML table out of it,","much simpler than you would","have to for a traditional database.","Have some type of application layer just to","figure out all of these properties and do,","like you said, the joints across network boundaries.","Yeah, that's sounds really","interesting for IOT and retail, but gaming?",">> So gaming where we see a lot of","uptick is really the elasticity that","the Cosmos DB and DocumentDB API","components really provide you.","One of the big challenges in gaming","is for most industries,","what you see is if you were to look at time and","the number of requests per second,","most industries have a curve","that looks something like this.","Its up into the right and the adoption grows over time.","However, for a lot of video games,","what you'll find is the adoption curve","actually is the opposite.","And the reason why that is is games","don't age as gracefully as most other applications.","You might use a five-year-old database,","but not a whole lot of us like","to play a five-year-old video games.","And so what ends up happening is you actually get","your peak usage near the beginning.","What you do is you really build","up a lot of","momentum and hype around your video game early on.","And at that very critical moment,","if you do things right,","you'll get awesome reviews on Metacritic,","on Steam, or whatever platform that you're using.","And this becomes a nice way","of extending out the life of the game.","However, if you fail to scale on day one,","you end up bombing your reviews,","and it's very, very hard to recover from that.",">> Oh yeah, I remember a lot of games where","they weren't working on the first day or two,","and it never retained that crowd back.","So being able to hit that peak usage right away and then","taper off and spin less as you have less users,","that can make a lot of sense to gaming companies.",">> And so really,","the value that Cosmos DB provides is you can,","at a click of a button, quickly scale up.","Let's say, you hit the front page of","every major social media website, you're doing well.","You can say, \"Okay,","I need a scale today.\"","But then as time goes on,","if you were to build that system","on, let's say, on-premise,","once you buy a machine,","you've sunk that costs and you're going to pay very,","very high amount of money to provision those resources.","It's a very costly and wasteful exercise when you go,","\"Hey most of my machines here are","now greatly underutilized over time.\"","So being able to ramp back","down the amount of throughput you've provisioned","is also an awesome way of really","getting the most bang for your buck with Cosmos DB.",">> So tell you, IOT, retail, gaming,","that's a lot of industries that could really benefit from","the DocumentDB API and","Cosmos DB and all the different features it provides."]}
