0
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,530
All right, we've been looking at constructing logical arguments.

1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:08,020
In previous lessons, we looked at two different argument forms,

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,640
deductive arguments and inductive arguments.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,990
What I wanna do now is start to give you some very specific

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:16,790
deductive argument forms.

5
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,140
So these are, again, only going to apply to deductive arguments,

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,080
and they are valid argument forms.

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,690
You can use these basic forms, plug in various terms and

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,060
create deductive arguments from them, all right?

9
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,550
So we're gonna continue on looking at argument forms, but

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:33,600
we're gonna focus now on looking at very specific

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,330
deductive argument forms that you can use

12
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:37,720
to construct arguments, all right?

13
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:40,250
So let's remember that deductive arguments,

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,080
we would call syllogisms.

15
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:47,215
Syllogisms have exactly two premises and one conclusion.

16
00:00:47,215 --> 00:00:50,700
And the syllogisms, again, are rules that given the truth of

17
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,800
the premises, the conclusion necessarily follows.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,137
And this is gonna be true for

19
00:00:55,137 --> 00:00:58,360
every deductive argument form that we look at.

20
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,430
All right, I'm gonna give you a symbolic representation.

21
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:01,800
I'll give you an example.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,530
I'll give you the Latin name for each of these forms.

23
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,960
And then you can use these, not only to construct arguments but

24
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:11,970
as you're doing any kind of reading, both in literature,

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,248
newspaper, anything.

26
00:01:13,248 --> 00:01:14,930
Anybody that wants to make an argument,

27
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:18,590
you can start to look at the arguments they're making and

28
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,790
see if you can find the symbolic representation,

29
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,430
the form of those arguments that you're reading about, okay?

30
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,630
So the first argument we've see already in a previous lesson,

31
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:32,730
it's called modus ponens, literally means the mode of

32
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:36,910
putting, the modus ponens argument, all right?

33
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:39,058
The form of the argument looks like this,

34
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:43,010
actually this is the symbolic representation

35
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,130
that's verbalized in an English sentence.

36
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,495
We say if p then q.

37
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:50,476
And here's why we call it the mode of putting,

38
00:01:50,476 --> 00:01:54,299
we're gonna put forth the antecedent of the conditional in

39
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,030
the first premise.

40
00:01:56,030 --> 00:01:58,750
We're asserting it, we're claiming it's true.

41
00:01:58,750 --> 00:02:02,180
All right, so we're gonna assert the antecedent here and

42
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,500
then that allows us to conclude the consequent.

43
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,190
All right, here's an example.

44
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,540
If Jerry grows a mustache, then George grows one.

45
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:13,750
Jerry does grow a mustache, again, asserting that antecedent

46
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,620
in the first conditional, first premise, we can then conclude

47
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,190
therefore George will grow a mustache, all right?

48
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,165
And then here is the symbolic form of that argument,

49
00:02:23,165 --> 00:02:25,589
p arrow q.

50
00:02:25,589 --> 00:02:31,460
Assert p conclude q, the modus ponens argument.

51
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:35,310
And remember, you can insert any value, any simple or compound

52
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,670
statement for p or q and the structure is still valid, right?

53
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:43,810
And obviously you wanna use true premises there, so

54
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,660
that you can conclude something that's also true.

55
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:50,110
But this is the modus ponens form, it's always valid,

56
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:54,790
and it's a deductive form of argumentation, modus ponens.

57
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,500
Let's look at the next one.

58
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,980
This is called the modus tollens or the mode of taking.

59
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,750
The mode of taking, the modus tollens argument.

60
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,559
Again, another valid argument form.

61
00:03:06,559 --> 00:03:08,200
This one says if p then q,

62
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,875
conditional in the first premise we're gonna negate or

63
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:15,641
take away, that's why it's called the mode of taking.

64
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:19,220
We're gonna negate the consequent in the second

65
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:24,369
premise, not q, therefore we can conclude with logical necessity,

66
00:03:24,369 --> 00:03:27,001
therefore not p, therefore not p.

67
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:29,980
If p then q, not q therefore not p.

68
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,400
Notice that it's different from the modus ponens,

69
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,440
in that in the modus ponens we're asserting the antecedent

70
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,410
and concluding the consequent.

71
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:39,630
Here we're negating the consequent and

72
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,340
asserting the antecedent.

73
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:43,060
All right, here's an example,

74
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,810
if you are in college then you are exhausted.

75
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,140
It's not the case that you're exhausted.

76
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:51,453
Therefore, it is not the case that you're in college.

77
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:54,517
Now you might say that there's something, what does that mean,

78
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:57,245
how come we can we say that it's not the case that you're in

79
00:03:57,245 --> 00:04:00,240
college based on the case that you're not exhausted?

80
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,827
Because the first premise tells us that it's necessarily true

81
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,950
that if you're in college then you must be exhausted.

82
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,628
Since you're not exhausted,

83
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:11,410
it's impossible that you're in college, okay?

84
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:13,524
That's what the form of the argument,

85
00:04:13,524 --> 00:04:16,734
that's what a deductive argument allows us to do, right.

86
00:04:16,734 --> 00:04:19,020
And here's the symbolic form.

87
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:22,200
We say p arrow q, ~q therefore ~p,

88
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,540
that's the form of the argument.

89
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:28,590
You can plug any value, compound or simple statements for p or

90
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,450
q, still have a valid argument form and

91
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,630
construct a valid logical argument.

92
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,480
Whether the argument is sound of course is gonna be dependent

93
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,940
upon whether or not your premises are true, all right?

94
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,950
Now, I'm gonna give you some real-world

95
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,880
examples of modus tollens at work.

96
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,950
All right, you can see how, in literature,

97
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:51,960
you can actually pull these argument forms out when you're

98
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,945
reading something in a book or a newspaper or whatever.

99
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:58,770
Here's a couple of examples of a modus tollens argument

100
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,180
in literature and in a scientific publication.

101
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,885
First one is from Sherlock Holmes, all right?

102
00:05:04,885 --> 00:05:08,190
Here's what Holmes says, a dog was kept in the stalls, and

103
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,210
yet, though someone had been in and

104
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:13,670
fetched out a horse, he had not barked.

105
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:17,550
Obviously the visitor was someone whom the dog knew well.

106
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:19,770
That is the modus tollens argument,

107
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:20,950
it's the mode of taking.

108
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,500
You can actually pull out the premises here and

109
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:27,080
stick it in that logical structure, in that form, and

110
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,930
see how it is a modus tollens.

111
00:05:28,930 --> 00:05:32,040
In fact, if you wanna pause your video, try to do that.

112
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,485
Try to pull out the premises of Holmes' argument and

113
00:05:35,485 --> 00:05:38,990
put it in a modus tollens form from the previous slide.

114
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,550
See if you can do that.

115
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,150
Here's another example.

116
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:45,630
If the universe were infinitely old, there would be no hydrogen

117
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:49,080
left in it since hydrogen is steadily converted into helium

118
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,980
throughout the universe and this conversion is a one-way process.

119
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,910
But in fact the universe consists almost

120
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,810
entirely of hydrogen.

121
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:59,700
It is not the case that, even though it looks like a positive

122
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:03,440
statement, Hoyle is actually reversing the truth value

123
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,960
of the consequent in the first premise.

124
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,350
Thus the universe must have had a definite beginning according

125
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,480
to Hoyle, right?

126
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:14,480
Very interesting argument that is a modus tollens argument.

127
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,400
Again, if you wanted to pause the video,

128
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,610
see if you can put the argument

129
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:23,480
into modus tollens form in the format that we looked at before.

130
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,523
But these are two examples of modus tollens, the mode of

131
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:30,102
taking argument in literature and in a scientific publication.

132
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:34,406
There's another type of modus tollens that we can make,

133
00:06:34,406 --> 00:06:37,602
another type of argument and I wanna look at that as well.

134
00:06:37,602 --> 00:06:41,469
Have you ever had a conversation with someone, and said okay, for

135
00:06:41,469 --> 00:06:44,660
the sake of argument I'm gonna assume you're right.

136
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:45,638
Let's see what happens,

137
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:47,555
let's see what happens if I assume you're right.

138
00:06:47,555 --> 00:06:50,743
That's a modus tollens type of argument and

139
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:55,640
it's called a reductio ad absurdum, that's the Latin name.

140
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,400
Literally means a reduction to the absurd,

141
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,060
a reductio ad absurdum.

142
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:03,592
But it's a type of motus tollens at the end of the day,

143
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:05,040
all right?

144
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:10,164
So let's suppose you wanna prove proposition p is true,

145
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,512
you assume its negation,

146
00:07:12,512 --> 00:07:17,940
you assume that not p is true or that p is false, okay?

147
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,470
Remember your goal is to prove p,

148
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:23,050
but you're gonna start by assuming that p is false.

149
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:28,120
From that assumption, you derive another proposition, and

150
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,280
that proposition has to be false because it's absurd, okay?

151
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,890
So if not p is true, this other thing turns out to be also true.

152
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:40,720
But that other thing, that q,

153
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,170
is false, because it's absurd, therefore p must be true.

154
00:07:46,170 --> 00:07:48,810
In other words it's impossible that not p is true

155
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:53,410
because it involves a contradiction or an absurdity.

156
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,790
That's a reductio ad absurdum argument, and

157
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,940
it is a type of modus tollens.

158
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,460
Now, if this is a little confusing,

159
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,170
let me give you an example to show you how this actually works

160
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,700
in the real world.

161
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,090
Let's suppose that you wanna prove that the earth is round.

162
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:10,960
You start by assuming it's a negation.

163
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,690
So you say, suppose the earth is flat.

164
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:16,160
If the earth is flat, it has edges and

165
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,011
it would be possible to fall off the edge.

166
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:20,980
In such a case, people and animals

167
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:23,690
regularly would be falling off the edge of the earth.

168
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:28,020
But that's a ridiculous think to believe, because people and

169
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,670
animals don't actually fall off the earth, it's an absurdity.

170
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:34,590
So assuming the opposite of the thing you wanna prove,

171
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,090
that the earth is round, assuming that the earth is flat,

172
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,680
we end up with an absurdity that animals and

173
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,220
people are constantly falling off the earth.

174
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,800
That's just not true.

175
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,250
Therefore, it seems clear that the earth is not flat or

176
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,270
the earth is round.

177
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:52,490
That's our original proposition that we wanna prove to be true.

178
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,250
So this is essentially a modus tollens argument

179
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,880
in the reductio ad absurdum form.

180
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,770
And anytime you say to a friend or

181
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:02,991
someone else that you are talking with, a colleague.

182
00:09:02,991 --> 00:09:06,703
Anytime you say, okay, for the sake of argument let's assume

183
00:09:06,703 --> 00:09:10,767
you're true, your conclusion is true, you're using a reductio ad

184
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,866
absurdum argument which is a form of modus tollens.

185
00:09:13,866 --> 00:09:17,597
So that's a very interesting way that we can use that same type

186
00:09:17,597 --> 00:09:20,683
of argumentation form in a little bit of a different

187
00:09:20,683 --> 00:09:21,280
format.

188
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:26,545
All right, the third one I wanna give you is called

189
00:09:26,545 --> 00:09:28,670
the hypothetical syllogism.

190
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:32,399
And you can see from the name probably that we're gonna be

191
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,350
working with conditionals here.

192
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:37,450
All right, the form of the argument looks like this.

193
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:44,360
If p then q, if q then r, therefore if p then r.

194
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,780
So we're taking the consequent of the first conditional and

195
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:52,530
making it the antecedent of the second conditional, and

196
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:54,590
introducing a new consequent.

197
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,202
And then in the conclusion,

198
00:09:56,202 --> 00:09:59,091
we take the antecedent of the first conditional and

199
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:01,846
associate that with the consequent of the second

200
00:10:01,846 --> 00:10:05,565
conditional in a new conditional in the conclusion, all right?

201
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:07,209
So here's an example,

202
00:10:07,209 --> 00:10:11,000
if you're a Monty Python fan you'll recognize this.

203
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,690
If she's as light as a duck then she's as light as wood.

204
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,160
If she's as light as wood, then she will float in water.

205
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,899
Therefore, if she's as light as a duck,

206
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:21,150
then she will float in water.

207
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,506
And again, if you look at this intuitively,

208
00:10:23,506 --> 00:10:25,370
you can see how this works, right?

209
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:28,990
By making these associations between antecedents and

210
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,240
consequents we can actually come up with that third conditional

211
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,499
in the conclusion, and you can see how all that works together.

212
00:10:37,499 --> 00:10:42,111
And here's our symbolic form, if p arrow q, q arrow r,

213
00:10:42,111 --> 00:10:45,050
conclusion therefore p arrow r.

214
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:47,325
And that's our hypothetical syllogism.

215
00:10:47,325 --> 00:10:50,320
All right, so now we have three.

216
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,654
We have our modus ponens, we have our modus tollens, we saw

217
00:10:53,654 --> 00:10:57,269
a couple of different forms of that, the reductio ad absurdum.

218
00:10:57,269 --> 00:11:01,600
And now we've got a third called the hypothetical syllogism.

219
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,430
And we're gonna end with one final one called the disjunctive

220
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:07,380
syllogism, the disjunctive syllogism.

221
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,900
If you remember from our previous lesson,

222
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,510
we looked at the disjunctive symbol, the disjunction symbol.

223
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:16,370
Now we're gonna look at that symbol used in a syllogism.

224
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:21,250
The form is p or q for the first premise, and the second premise

225
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,860
we negate one of the disjuncts, it doesn't matter which one.

226
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,082
But whatever disjunct we negate,

227
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:31,154
that then allows us to assert as true the other disjunct, okay?

228
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:33,134
So p or q not p, therefore, q or

229
00:11:33,134 --> 00:11:36,130
we could say in the second premise not q.

230
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:38,779
That would allow us in the conclusion to assert,

231
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:40,068
therefore p, right?

232
00:11:40,068 --> 00:11:42,710
Example, either The Beatles are playing tonight or

233
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,750
The Rolling Stones are playing.

234
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,520
It is not the case that The Beatles are playing, so it must

235
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:51,300
be true then that The Rolling Stones are playing, all right?

236
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,943
Or we can say,

237
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:54,415
it is not the case that The Rolling Stones are playing,

238
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:56,912
therefore it must be true logical necessity, right.

239
00:11:56,912 --> 00:12:00,328
The conclusion necessarily falls from the truth of the premises,

240
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:03,204
therefore it must be true that The Beatles are playing.

241
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,520
And here's our symbolic form.

242
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,340
We say p v p wedge q, ~p,

243
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:17,840
asserts as the conclusion q or ~q, asserts as the conclusion p.

244
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,905
So now we have added to your toolkit for

245
00:12:21,905 --> 00:12:25,000
deductive syllogisms.

246
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,442
Again, you can take the symbolic version of these,

247
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:30,610
plug in any simple or compound statement

248
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,270
to any of these syllogisms and you have a valid argument.

249
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:38,290
If you have true premises for your arguments, for

250
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:39,430
your syllogisms,

251
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:42,300
you're gonna end up with a sound argument at the end.

252
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,880
And you can use these

253
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,120
syllogisms together to build complex arguments, and

254
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:51,860
we'll see how this is done as we move throughout the course.

255
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:54,270
Again, I wanna call your attention to the similarity

256
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:56,920
between what we're doing here in formal logic and

257
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,460
what you might do in a computer program.

258
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,416
If you've written in any modern computer language, you have

259
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:06,608
used these constructs, you've used conditional statements.

260
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:09,958
You've used conjunction statements, disjunctions,

261
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:12,819
you've used those in your computer programming

262
00:13:12,819 --> 00:13:16,560
language to actually have a logical flow to your program.

263
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,699
And that's what we're doing with language,

264
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:21,360
that's what we're doing with concepts.

265
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,970
We're applying those logical flows to the way that we think

266
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,450
about the world, the way that we think about our ideas.

267
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,180
And it's very, very similar, right?

268
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,353
You're gonna use the same constructs in programming

269
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:33,290
as you're using in formal logic.

270
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:36,362
This is why learning formal logic can actually help you

271
00:13:36,362 --> 00:13:39,836
become a better programmer, because you're gonna learn how

272
00:13:39,836 --> 00:13:42,998
both of those things work together and work in synergy.

273
00:13:42,998 --> 00:13:45,087
So as we move throughout the rest of the course,

274
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,801
we're gonna start to apply some of these concepts to what we do

275
00:13:47,801 --> 00:13:48,810
in computer science.
