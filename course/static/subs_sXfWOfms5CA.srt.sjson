So, I'm interested in","Graph API and I want to know some of","the scenarios where people use Graph API,","that's going to help me make some decisions","about when Graph API","fits in my application and my data storage scenarios.","So, can you tell me about some of","the common business scenarios","where we would use Graph API?",">> Absolutely.","So, the common graph scenarios that actually","can be applied to many different business verticals","include social networks,","recommendations,","logistics, Internet of Things and devices.","So, let's dive into each one of these scenarios.","First one, let's talk about social networks.","So, I've got a graph here,","which contains the vertices are","the people and the edges are","the relationships between those people.","So for example, Samantha is friends with","Isabella but not friends with","Lucy because Isabella is friends with Lucy.","Okay. That's a simple social network.","Okay that we've got here.","Now, let's go to restaurant recommendations.","Now, it's a slightly little bit","different because what you've got here is","the notes are not","just the restaurants themselves","in this case as Kintaro Ramen,","or Motomachi, or Banana Leaf.","Okay. But also the location in this case Vancouver.","Okay. And also the cuisine type.","So these are different notes or","different vertices and the","relationship between the vertices for example,","between Kintaro restaurant and Motomachi,","those are ramen restaurants.","So, they both basically have","an edge to the cuisine type of ramen.","While all three of the restaurants","are related to the location of Vancouver, BC.","What's really interesting about graphs is that right now,","in the previous slide,","I went ahead and called out social networks.",">> Right.",">> In the current slide,","I'm showing a restaurant recommendations.","They seem like two very disparate graphs,","but in fact you can actually merge them together.","Okay. And so what you'll notice here","actually is the exact same two sets of","graphs on social networks and restaurant recommendations.","But because I created a new edge,","which I highlighted in dark black here,","I can relate the ratings that each of","the people have done to the restaurants they have.","So, if I'm looking for restaurant recommendations,","I want to look at it based on my friends.","So Samantha has rated","Kintaro extremely high and so has Juliet.","So when Isabella wants to go ahead and","find a great ramen restaurant,","she can use her friends network to look at their ratings,","to figure out which restaurant she wants to work with.",">> Oh, I see. Looks like you use a combination of","entities as vertices and in","lots of different relationships is that just","to do some pretty interesting things here.",">> Right. And so you can take what's","seemingly disparate business problems,","merge them together, relate them together","in a graphed structure and solve it that way.","And so it's really cool that way.",">> Okay. Pretty interesting.",">> And so we've got some other ones.","And so logistics.","I'm actually just going to use","the standard flights scenario.","In this case the vertex is the airports,","the edges are the flights between the airport.","So, a common approach is if I want to fly","from San Jose to Buffalo.","Those are the two vertices.","Do I have any direct flights?","Possibly not. What is the fastest way to get there?","That's a graph problem,","in which I'm going to determine","what is the shortest path,","i.e., the least number of","edges to go from San Jose to Buffalo, okay?","So that's logistics. And this scenario","again can be applied to many other situations.",">> Okay, yes.",">> And another cool one, Internet of Things.","So, you see all these yellow dots floating around?","It doesn't seem very obvious, but these are devices.","And these are devices and how","these devices are related to each other?","Some devices are going to have","a very strong connection to","each other. Some of them are not.","And so this particular graph","that you're seeing right now is actually directly","from the Cosmos DB Graph API directly from the portal,","as the portal itself. So it's pretty cool.",">> Allright. In this graph on","each of these dots that's a vertices?",">> Correct. Each dot is a vertex.","Each line is an edge.","And this is the relationship","between the devices with each other.",">> Okay.","And specifically devices.","This is a standard shock that we have","directly from our Graph API documentation.","It notes the fact that we're","actually doing a relation between","people, devices, and location.","So, just like we noted before,","you have very disparate sets of","information all represented by your vertex.",">> Oh, yes.","And I see lots of other stuff","like operating system, interests.","You can tell a lot about people from","the combination of edges and vertex.","With each individual vertex that those edges connect to.","That seems very interesting.",">> Yes. It's extremely powerful and that's the reason why","graph databases are really interesting,","because how you associate problems together,","actually, can be done really well with graph databases.","The usual problem is can we do it fast?","And that's the great thing about Cosmos DB.","We power together both the graph","capabilities with the fast storage","to give you fast graphs as well.",">> Okay. Yes, yes.","Very interesting.",">> Yes.",">> And one of the things I'd tell","you with all these scenarios.","They can be applied to different business problems like","especially logistics you know can be applied to","things not just airlines.","And one of the most interesting things","about this is we can continue use this one","through out various problems and","the vertices and edges","even though they are a little","different to what we're used to.","I mean this definitely breaks it down.","I'm very interested in learning more","about those particular concepts.",">> Excellent."]}
