00:00:01,898 --> 00:00:02,725
In this video,

1
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:06,550
I'm going to show you how to constructing user truth table.

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:10,420
You recall from a previous topic that truth tables are used

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:14,150
to determine whether an overall argument is true or false.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:16,692
So when you're making a declarative statement and

5
00:00:16,692 --> 00:00:19,351
statement of truth, for example something simple,

6
00:00:19,351 --> 00:00:22,201
the sky is blue, that statement is either true or false.

7
00:00:22,201 --> 00:00:24,616
And you can assign it a truth value of t or f and

8
00:00:24,616 --> 00:00:28,010
that's pretty clear, we understand what that means.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,460
You wanna do the same thing for entire arguments.

10
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,921
And so, what we're gonna do is look at a truth table and

11
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:35,489
how a truth table can help you determine the overall truth

12
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:37,430
value of an argument.

13
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:39,792
I did also describe this in written form in a previous

14
00:00:39,792 --> 00:00:42,313
topic, so if you wanna see the written version of this,

15
00:00:42,313 --> 00:00:44,314
you can go back and take a look at that topic.

16
00:00:44,314 --> 00:00:46,368
There are also some concepts in here,

17
00:00:46,368 --> 00:00:49,320
we're gonna look at compound statements, and how you

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,060
determine the overall truth value of a compound statement.

19
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:54,680
I'm assuming that you know what that means.

20
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,800
We've looked at this in previous lesson, so

21
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,700
if you need to go back and review that.

22
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,310
Before you watch the video,

23
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,930
I'd take some time to look at those concepts first and

24
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,200
then the video will make a lot more sense.

25
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,523
But as we look at this truth table, what we're gonna do is,

26
00:01:07,523 --> 00:01:09,060
this is our argument here on the right.

27
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,038
And we're gonna look at how you can get to a single truth value

28
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:16,860
for that over all argument by breaking the pieces down into

29
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:19,200
individual components.

30
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,010
And as you can see in the argument,

31
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,990
we're using a number of variables.

32
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:26,451
Our variables are listed in the table on the left-hand side.

33
00:01:26,451 --> 00:01:29,300
And the left-hand side is sort of like a ledger.

34
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:32,610
Just tells us what variables we're using and

35
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:35,400
what truth values those variables we're gonna have.

36
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,489
Then we're gonna use those values in the argument itself.

37
00:01:40,489 --> 00:01:42,352
So that's really what a truth table looks like.

38
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,204
We're gonna have one more row in this truth table, and

39
00:01:45,204 --> 00:01:47,932
you'll see how those rows can help us determine what

40
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:50,590
the overall truth value of the argument is.

41
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:52,060
So let's get started.

42
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,260
The first thing we wanna do is assign our variables values,

43
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,605
our truth values.

44
00:01:57,605 --> 00:02:02,360
We wanna sign each variable a specific truth value.

45
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:04,990
Now in this example, all of this is completely arbitrary.

46
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,890
These values, these variables aren't referencing or

47
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,510
pointing to any specific propositions.

48
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,440
I just picked the letters p, q, r, s, and t.

49
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,154
And I'm gonna randomly assign them truth values.

50
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:19,077
When you're analyzing an argument,

51
00:02:19,077 --> 00:02:22,200
you're gonna assign your propositions variables.

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,490
And you're gonna work to determine what the truth value

53
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,480
or possible truth value is of those propositions.

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,730
And that's how you'll proceed to analyze your argument.

55
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:33,590
But this this argument is completely arbitrary and

56
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,220
just used for the purposes of this example.

57
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,771
So let's take a look at what this will look like.

58
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:44,100
So here I have assigned truth values to each of our variables.

59
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,030
Again, this is some arbitrary, I just assigned true

60
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:51,300
to the variable p, false to the variable q and so forth.

61
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,870
And these truth values are gonna get us started with this whole

62
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:56,660
process of using a truth table to determine the truth

63
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,410
value of the argument.

64
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,310
We have to have a way to kinda prime the pump and

65
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,870
that's what we're doing by assigning these values, okay?

66
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:07,280
Now the next step that I'm gonna do is carry those values

67
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,380
into the argument itself.

68
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,520
Since we know what each variable is assigned,

69
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,280
the truth value of each variable,

70
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,710
we can then use those values to look at our argument itself.

71
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,630
So let's do that next, let's carry these values over

72
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,945
into the argument and that will allow us to get started.

73
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:28,200
So there you have it, so now I've just taken the values for

74
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,685
each of the variables and

75
00:03:29,685 --> 00:03:33,165
put them under the variable in the argument itself.

76
00:03:33,165 --> 00:03:36,675
So here I've taken obviously the T from p and

77
00:03:36,675 --> 00:03:38,675
put that under the p in the argument.

78
00:03:38,675 --> 00:03:40,625
I've taken the false from q and

79
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:44,320
put the false under the q in the argument itself.

80
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,077
Now what we've done here is since we know what the variable

81
00:03:47,077 --> 00:03:47,696
values are,

82
00:03:47,696 --> 00:03:50,298
that allows us to now work on the compound statements.

83
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:52,952
And again if you don't know what that means, you'll need to go

84
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:55,405
back into a previous lesson and take a look at that lesson so

85
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:58,180
you understand what we're talking about there.

86
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,276
But now that we know the values for the variables,

87
00:04:01,276 --> 00:04:03,783
we can start to break apart the values for

88
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:06,305
the individual compounds statements.

89
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,409
When you're working on an argument, or

90
00:04:09,409 --> 00:04:12,245
when you're working on a truth table, liking algebra,

91
00:04:12,245 --> 00:04:14,843
or other mathematics, you're gonna look at the way

92
00:04:14,843 --> 00:04:17,920
that the parenthesis, and brackets are assigned.

93
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,680
And you're gonna work from the inside out.

94
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,690
You wanna work on what's called the operator

95
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,370
of the smallest scope.

96
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,730
Another way to think about the operator of the smallest scope

97
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,010
is that, it's the operator that has the least

98
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,030
impact on the other variables in the argument.

99
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:35,920
So as we look at this argument, obviously there's a disjunction,

100
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,180
we can see here.

101
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,920
There's two conjunctions, and there's a conditional.

102
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,760
Right, so we have four compound statements that we're gonna have

103
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,770
to work on.

104
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,570
And we can see that the parentheses and the brackets

105
00:04:46,570 --> 00:04:49,620
help us determine which is the operator of the small scope.

106
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,560
And hopefully, your eyes went to this guy right here,

107
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,450
this innermost disjunction.

108
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,010
So that's the one that we'll start to work on

109
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:00,070
as we work through this argument, okay?

110
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,730
So we're gonna work on the operator of the small scope and

111
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:05,320
then work outward to help us figure out what the overall

112
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,090
argument is.

113
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,490
All right, so let me get rid of some of the text here.

114
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,203
So now let's work on that first argument, or sorry,

115
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,570
that first compound statement.

116
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,510
So we have a false for r and

117
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:20,100
a T for s, and those of the are variables which

118
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,400
the truth now is being assign to the variables.

119
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,100
And now we need to figure out with the overall truth value is

120
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,850
for that disjunction.

121
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:31,861
Now you remember that the rule for disjunction says, that if

122
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:37,176
at least one disjunct is true, the entire disjunction is true.

123
00:05:37,176 --> 00:05:37,738
If at least one disjunct is true,

124
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,770
the entire disjunction is true.

125
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,240
If both are false, the entire thing is false.

126
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,884
So if we look at our disjunction,

127
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:44,248
we have r is false but s is T.

128
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:48,810
So that gives us, that follows the rule one disjunct is true,

129
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,740
so we can assign the entire disjunction as true.

130
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:56,833
And that looks like this So

131
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:00,977
you can see, because we followed our rule,

132
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:06,913
we're gonna assign the disjunct, as a whole, the value of T,

133
00:06:06,913 --> 00:06:12,540
or true based on the values in the disjunction, all right?

134
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,910
So that now we have our first compound statement solved for.

135
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:17,850
We know what the truth value of that is.

136
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,000
But we need to still continue to work on the other compound

137
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,920
statements to get to our overall argument value, truth value,

138
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,630
all right?

139
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,390
So how do we do that?

140
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:28,130
Well, the next one, we're gonna work outwards,

141
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:29,340
as I said earlier.

142
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,850
The next compound statement is gonna be this ampersand,

143
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,810
this convention.

144
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:39,760
And, we're gonna end up with two conjuncts in this convention.

145
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,352
The first one should be easy for you to see,

146
00:06:42,352 --> 00:06:45,520
it's gonna be T here, and it has a value of true, but

147
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,420
what is the second conjunct?

148
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,380
Well since we solved the disjunction as a whole,

149
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:53,840
we no longer have to worry about these two variables.

150
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,770
We can now only focus on the value of the disjunction

151
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:58,740
as a whole.

152
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:03,490
So this disjunction value is our second conjunct

153
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:05,680
in the conjunction, all right?

154
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,820
And again, that follows the rules and

155
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,850
the setup that we talked about earlier.

156
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:11,740
So now that we have those established,

157
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,540
we know what the truth values are for both the conjuncts,

158
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:16,570
we can solve for the conjunction.

159
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,810
And our rule for conjunction says that if both conjuncts

160
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,730
are true, the conjunction, as a whole, is true.

161
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,080
If one or more conjuncts is false, then the conjunction,

162
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,450
as a whole, is false.

163
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:32,160
So as we look at our conjunction, we have a T for

164
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,130
the first conjunct and a T for the second conjunct, so

165
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,850
that means both conjuncts are true.

166
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,680
So that makes our whole conjunction true.

167
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,720
And so that's gonna look like this.

168
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,140
And now we have our value for our second conjunction.

169
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:50,510
So as we continue to work outwards, we're solving for

170
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,250
each of the compound statements based on the values of

171
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:55,690
the previous compound statements we solved for.

172
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,500
And that's why it was so

173
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,960
important to have truth values for our variables,

174
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:02,860
because that allows us to work on these compound statements.

175
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:05,190
Now again, we still don't have the overall argument yet,

176
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,900
we're still working on our statements here.

177
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,624
So we've gotta work on the next conjunction which is the next

178
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:14,836
one out in terms of our layers, so if we look at this,

179
00:08:14,836 --> 00:08:16,673
we have two conjuncts again.

180
00:08:16,673 --> 00:08:19,380
So the q is the first conjunct.

181
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:22,416
Again, since we solve now for the second of the first

182
00:08:22,416 --> 00:08:25,866
conjunction, we're gonna use the overall truth value for

183
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:28,011
that as the second conjunct, okay.

184
00:08:28,011 --> 00:08:33,510
So these two now become the conjuncts for this conjunction.

185
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:35,833
Right, so again, let's look at our rule.

186
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:38,211
Our rule says, if both conjuncts are true,

187
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,589
the conjunction as a whole is true, if one or

188
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:43,690
more is false the conjunction as a whole is false.

189
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,510
So since the q has a value of false, or F, then it

190
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,980
follows the rule that the whole conjunction has been false.

191
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:53,610
So we're gonna assign an F to the conjunction as a whole.

192
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,920
And that looks like this.

193
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,860
So now we've solved for the truth value of the second

194
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,950
conjunction, and that's here, and that has a value of false.

195
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:06,800
So we're not quite there yet.

196
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,908
We still don't have the truth value for the overall argument,

197
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:10,310
we still have to look at the conditional.

198
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:13,900
So we're gonna solve for that next.

199
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,720
As we look at our conditional, we have our antecedent

200
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,960
which is the part that comes before the if.

201
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,210
Remember this says F, p, then the rest of the statement.

202
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,280
So the part that come before the F is antecedent,

203
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,430
that's the p and it has a T or true.

204
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:33,880
And then the consequent of our conditional is gonna be this

205
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:37,920
whole phrase here we just solved for.

206
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,947
The conjunction, the value of the conjunction is gonna be

207
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:43,866
the consequent of this conditional and that's false.

208
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:49,550
So T for the antecedent, and false or F for the consequent.

209
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:54,130
Now a rule says for conditional, if the antecedent is true and

210
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:56,010
the consequent is false,

211
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,980
then the conditional as a whole is false.

212
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,090
And remember the rules says that, that's only conditions

213
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:03,850
under which the entire conditional would be false.

214
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,570
So that follows this pattern, so

215
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,710
we have overall false conditional.

216
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,660
And so we assign the conditional as a whole as false.

217
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,288
Now what we've done is, we've solved now for

218
00:10:17,288 --> 00:10:18,090
the entire argument.

219
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,210
We have our final value, and this final value,

220
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:25,560
we assign to the operator which is a conditional operator.

221
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,440
And because it's the last in line,

222
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:30,600
it's the furthest out, it has the largest scope.

223
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,180
We call it the operator of the largest scope.

224
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,493
This is the operator of the largest scope because it impacts

225
00:10:35,493 --> 00:10:36,381
the entire argument.

226
00:10:36,381 --> 00:10:38,542
This is the final compound statement,

227
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:42,110
we would need to solve for once we solve for all the others.

228
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:45,480
So if we're looking for the truth value of the overall

229
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,790
argument, this is it, it's false.

230
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,440
The truth value of this entire argument here turns out to be

231
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,830
false based on how we structure the argument,

232
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:59,130
and how we worked on our truth table.

233
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:02,613
So if someone would ask you,

234
00:11:02,613 --> 00:11:05,040
what is the truth value of this entire argument?

235
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,669
You would point to the operator of the largest scope,

236
00:11:07,669 --> 00:11:08,779
the conditional, and

237
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:11,720
you would say the entire argument is false.

238
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,880
Okay, and that's how you use a truth value, sorry,

239
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,990
this is how you use a truth table to determine the truth

240
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:18,880
value of an overall argument,

241
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,950
by assigning the individual variables' values.

242
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:25,287
You can then plug those truth values into the argument as

243
00:11:25,287 --> 00:11:28,908
a whole, and then work on your compound statements until you

244
00:11:28,908 --> 00:11:30,479
get the operative scope.

245
00:11:30,479 --> 00:11:33,283
And the truth value of the operator of the largest scope is

246
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:35,276
the truth value of the entire argument.
