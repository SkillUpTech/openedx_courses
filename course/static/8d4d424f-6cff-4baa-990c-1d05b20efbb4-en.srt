0
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,115
We've been looking at how to construct logical arguments

1
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:06,810
made-up of premises and conclusions.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,400
And the first thing we looked at in a previous lesson was

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,150
statements.

4
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,234
Statements are linguistic, they're made up of some

5
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:16,325
language, and they're declarative of sentences.

6
00:00:16,325 --> 00:00:18,760
They essentially make a claim to truth.

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:22,720
Now we wanna look at what statements are of,

8
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,720
what consists of a statement for logic, okay?

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,030
And we're gonna look at propositions as the underlying

10
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,590
foundation for a statement.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,140
Any time you make a claim of truth, you're actually going to

12
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:37,960
be declaring that some proposition is true and

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,180
we wanna look at that now.

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,975
Okay, you're using language to do it, but

15
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,570
you're actually talking about propositions.

16
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:47,500
Propositions can be a little esoteric.

17
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,360
They can be a little odd to understand, but

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,960
hopefully you'll see the value of talking about propositions

19
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,820
as I move through this, all right?

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:59,400
So earlier I said that premises and conclusions are statements,

21
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,650
and really statements only are representative or

22
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:07,120
symbols for something else called propositions.

23
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,390
And propositions really are the meaning behind the statements

24
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:11,650
that we make.

25
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:14,700
So anytime I make a declaration in language,

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,070
if I say the grass is green, really what I'm doing is

27
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,650
using language to symbolize a meaning, a proposition.

28
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:24,410
That's what propositions are.

29
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,977
And you'll see how this works in just a moment.

30
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:27,808
All right, so

31
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:32,110
propositions themselves are the things that are true or false.

32
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,780
Propositions are the things that are true or false.

33
00:01:34,780 --> 00:01:40,032
The statements alone are only symbols of that, okay?

34
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:42,724
And so then a proposition is different from a sentence or

35
00:01:42,724 --> 00:01:43,670
statement.

36
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:47,362
It's different from that linguistic context,

37
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:51,414
because the proposition is actually the thing that is

38
00:01:51,414 --> 00:01:54,655
what is true or false, and the statement or

39
00:01:54,655 --> 00:01:58,182
the sentence is just a symbol for that, okay?

40
00:01:58,182 --> 00:02:03,048
So philosopher Peter Van Inwagen says that a proposition

41
00:02:03,048 --> 00:02:07,112
is a non-linguistic bearer of truth-value.

42
00:02:07,112 --> 00:02:08,450
Now that's a mouthful, right?

43
00:02:08,450 --> 00:02:10,235
That sounds a little intimidating, but

44
00:02:10,235 --> 00:02:11,870
let me talk through what this means.

45
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:16,082
Non-linguistic means that a proposition isn't

46
00:02:16,082 --> 00:02:19,497
necessarily a language-based thing.

47
00:02:19,497 --> 00:02:22,745
It's the thing that stands behind our language,

48
00:02:22,745 --> 00:02:26,700
it's the thing that stands behind our grammar, all right?

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,330
So put another way, it's the meaning, it's the meaning of

50
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:31,660
the thing that we're concerned about, all right?

51
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,510
And truth value, as we've seen in previous lessons,

52
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,920
is just whether something is true or false.

53
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,400
And it's the proposition that is true or

54
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,000
false, it's not the expression itself, okay?

55
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,710
It's not the statement itself.

56
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,390
Let me give you an example, I'm gonna try to

57
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,236
turn to the whiteboard here and use mathematics as an example.

58
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:59,415
So let's suppose I, in red ink, wrote this.

59
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,983
Now, I don't know if you can see that, that's red.

60
00:03:04,983 --> 00:03:07,752
It is a red numeral 2, okay?

61
00:03:07,752 --> 00:03:10,214
Now when you first see this, you might think, well,

62
00:03:10,214 --> 00:03:11,319
that's the number 2.

63
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:15,653
Some philosophers say this is actually not a number 2, but

64
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,952
a numeral 2, and

65
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:21,480
let's talk about the properties of this numeral.

66
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,760
This numeral is roughly, I would say, 10 to 12 inches tall.

67
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,410
It's red in color.

68
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:33,564
It's actually located on the screen here in this studio and

69
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:37,020
its maybe 5 or 6 inches wide, okay?

70
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,700
Those are properties of this numeral 2,

71
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,470
that I've drawn here on screen.

72
00:03:42,470 --> 00:03:45,800
Now let's ask about the properties of the number 2.

73
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:49,220
Is the number 2 red, no.

74
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,490
You can draw a number 2 on your own computer or you can draw

75
00:03:53,490 --> 00:03:55,628
a number 2 on a piece of paper in a different color,

76
00:03:55,628 --> 00:03:58,170
the number 2 itself is not red.

77
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:00,740
It's not a specific color at all.

78
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,600
Is the number 2, 12 inches tall, nope.

79
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,409
We would say that the number 2 doesn't have a height.

80
00:04:07,409 --> 00:04:09,598
Is the number 2 5 inches wide, no,

81
00:04:09,598 --> 00:04:12,670
all those properties are not true of the number 2.

82
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,579
Is it located anywhere, well of course not.

83
00:04:15,579 --> 00:04:17,260
So what's going on?

84
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:20,980
Well, what some philosophers believe is that this numeral

85
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,040
is a representation of the number and I can write the same

86
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,880
representation using dots, if I wanted to.

87
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,290
I can use dashes, right?

88
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,450
I can uses all sorts of things.

89
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,880
I can write it in binary if I wanted to.

90
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,476
And all of these are representations of that other

91
00:04:38,476 --> 00:04:40,617
thing called the number, and

92
00:04:40,617 --> 00:04:43,535
they represent it in the symbolic form.

93
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:47,060
We say these are symbols of something else, right?

94
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,360
So when we're talking about propositions,

95
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,310
we're talking essentially about exactly the same thing.

96
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:57,221
We're talking about these propositions are being

97
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:01,569
represented by the sentences that we claim.

98
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,429
Let me give you an example of how this works.

99
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,490
So if I said to you Pat likes Jan,

100
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,150
these are obviously two English sentences, and Jan is liked

101
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:17,770
by Pat, if I made those two declarative statements.

102
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,690
These are two different English sentences, right?

103
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,660
The first one has three words, the second one has five words.

104
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:27,610
The first one Pat comes first, the second one Jan comes first.

105
00:05:27,610 --> 00:05:29,160
But what are they doing?

106
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,540
Do they mean the same thing?

107
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,260
And most people would say without quibbling too much, yes,

108
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,820
they mean the same thing.

109
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:38,390
They are representative of the same idea.

110
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:42,920
So the way that logicians talk about this is that these two

111
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,380
different English sentences, these two different symbols,

112
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:50,250
represent or symbolize the proposition and

113
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,240
it's the proposition that's true, right?

114
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,000
It's the proposition that's true,

115
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,487
not the sentences themselves.

116
00:05:56,487 --> 00:05:59,810
Here's another example, we have two separate languages here.

117
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,440
The moon has craters, [FOREIGN].

118
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,363
And if you speak Spanish, I completely butchered that, so

119
00:06:06,363 --> 00:06:08,535
I apologize, but you get the idea, right?

120
00:06:08,535 --> 00:06:11,510
We have two different sentences in two different languages.

121
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,180
They both represent the same idea, and

122
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:16,110
that idea is the proposition, and

123
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:19,360
it's the proposition that's true or false, okay?

124
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,790
So each statement expresses the same truth,

125
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,440
that's really what we're after.

126
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,178
And we say that they express the same truth,

127
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:30,102
cuz they're exemplifying or symbolizing that proposition.

128
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:33,015
And why does this matter, why is this important at all?

129
00:06:33,015 --> 00:06:35,730
The reason it matters is because in logic,

130
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,750
what you really care about is getting to that proposition,

131
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:43,520
that truth value, and you can restate premises and conclusions

132
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,760
if it helps you get closer to what the actual meaning is.

133
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,280
So if you're analyzing an argument and you think that

134
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:55,360
the linguistic statement, the thing that the person wrote,

135
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,060
isn't clear enough, you can restate it to make it clearer.

136
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,550
Have you ever said to somebody, in other words,

137
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,720
what I think you're saying is, this is what you're doing.

138
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,010
You're trying to get to the proposition.

139
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,416
You're trying to get to the meaning by restating the words

140
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:13,640
that are being used ln that argument or

141
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,946
in the claim that the person is making.

142
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:19,630
And that's the role that propositions have here.

143
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,490
As long as we get to the correct meaning,

144
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:24,320
we can get to the truth value and we can use different words

145
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,970
to express it if it helps us clarify things.

146
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:29,120
And that's the value of propositions.

147
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,481
So now we see the relationship between statements,

148
00:07:31,481 --> 00:07:33,412
which are linguistic or grammatical, and

149
00:07:33,412 --> 00:07:36,372
propositions, which are the meaning behind those statements.

150
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,806
The statements symbolize the propositions and

151
00:07:38,806 --> 00:07:41,430
it's the propositions that have the truth value.
