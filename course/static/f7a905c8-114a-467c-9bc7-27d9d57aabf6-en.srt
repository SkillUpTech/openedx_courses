Hi, and welcome to this module on categorical logic.

1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,880
We've been looking at traditional syllogistic

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:09,480
logic and we're gonna transition now into what is called

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,080
categorical logic.

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,670
Which was largely developed by Aristotle back in the 400

5
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:16,940
BC era.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,590
And categorical logic has a very specific

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:22,080
approach that Aristotle took.

8
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,600
And to introduce this topic, I'm gonna talk a little bit

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,670
about Aristotle's metaphysics, or ontology.

10
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,404
Those terms simply mean the way that Aristotle looked at

11
00:00:33,404 --> 00:00:34,202
the world.

12
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:40,489
And his ontology really set up philosophy for the West.

13
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:44,007
Even to this day, we still use a lot of Aristotle's approach and

14
00:00:44,007 --> 00:00:45,180
categories.

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,060
As I say in the module itself, in the written part of

16
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,870
the module, Aristotle really invented or discovered or

17
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:55,430
however you want to term it the methodology that we use for

18
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,680
modern science today and modern scientific discovery.

19
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:03,090
And so what he did as he developed his ontology is he

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,740
defined terms that we use.

21
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,210
He defined the vocabulary that we're gonna use and

22
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:09,660
he also helped us to categorize things.

23
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,530
And that's sort of where we get this idea of categorical logic,

24
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:17,390
is that Aristotle really helped us to come up with the buckets

25
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,910
that we're gonna use in which we wanna place different things.

26
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,780
So I thought it would be helpful to go through Aristotle's

27
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,830
basic ontology as we get into this module, and

28
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:29,240
this gonna provide largely background.

29
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:32,400
As I talk through this and then you go through the lessons in

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,840
this module, you'll see how the two are connected.

31
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,060
If you understand this ontology it's gonna help you understand

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,730
why Aristotle developed a logic and a way of talking about

33
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:45,080
the categories that he developed in a very specific way.

34
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,140
You'll see the connection between these two.

35
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,780
And by the way, ontology comes from the Greek,

36
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,410
literally means being.

37
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:55,120
So the study of being, onto, being, logic,

38
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,410
or logos is the Greek term, a study of, a discourse on.

39
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,013
So it's really the study of being and

40
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:03,778
that's really what we're looking at.

41
00:02:03,778 --> 00:02:06,152
All right, let's get into some of what Aristotle and

42
00:02:06,152 --> 00:02:07,010
the early Greeks.

43
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:10,772
We're gonna actually look at the early Greeks a little bit as

44
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:13,428
well, including Plato and Socrates, and

45
00:02:13,428 --> 00:02:15,666
what they thought about ontology.

46
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:18,200
What they thought about how the world was structured.

47
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:21,413
All right, the first thing I wanna talk about is

48
00:02:21,413 --> 00:02:24,430
this topic called properties.

49
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:26,985
This word cloud represents a bunch of nouns and

50
00:02:26,985 --> 00:02:29,985
adjectives that we see and use everyday.

51
00:02:29,985 --> 00:02:34,795
And, when we're talking about ontology, the building blocks of

52
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:37,765
that discussion really starts with properties.

53
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:41,939
Properties are the things that all of ontology, particularly

54
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:45,572
Aristotle and Plato's ontology, are built up from.

55
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:46,230
And so we wanna just

56
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,180
spend a couple of minutes looking at what properties are.

57
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,190
Right., so properties again are the basic

58
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:54,725
building blocks of things in the world.

59
00:02:54,725 --> 00:02:57,950
They're the fundamental concept that we're gonna

60
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:01,050
use to talk about all these other topics.

61
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,982
All right, so

62
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:06,080
the best way to define a property is it's an attribute.

63
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,421
A characteristic of something or a component of what makes

64
00:03:11,421 --> 00:03:16,332
that thing what it is and not something else, right?

65
00:03:16,332 --> 00:03:20,908
So we can put it very simply, a property is the respect in which

66
00:03:20,908 --> 00:03:23,820
things are the same or differ.

67
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:27,304
A property is the respect in which things are the same or

68
00:03:27,304 --> 00:03:27,923
differ.

69
00:03:27,923 --> 00:03:30,820
As we get into categorical logic, you're gonna see how

70
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,283
important properties are when you're starting to define terms.

71
00:03:34,283 --> 00:03:37,506
As you move through the module we'll talk about how to use

72
00:03:37,506 --> 00:03:39,924
the logic of the categorical syllogism and

73
00:03:39,924 --> 00:03:42,949
the categorical statement to earmark properties and

74
00:03:42,949 --> 00:03:46,270
to put them into classes or categories of things, okay.

75
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,140
So when you think about a property, think about redness or

76
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,170
think about something that makes a thing what it is.

77
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,440
I'm wearing a black shirt, right.

78
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,000
This is infused with properties.

79
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,510
You can talk about the property of the fabric it's made up,

80
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:04,050
the color, the shape, the size.

81
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:08,260
All of those things would be the properties of the shirt, okay.

82
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,195
So that's a very simple definition of what

83
00:04:10,195 --> 00:04:11,370
a property is.

84
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,189
Let's get in to a little bit more specificity as we talk

85
00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:16,275
through this.

86
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:19,286
Philosophers and logicians distinguish between simple

87
00:04:19,286 --> 00:04:21,820
properties and complex properties.

88
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:26,290
A simple property is a property that cannot be reduced

89
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:27,590
to other properties.

90
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,053
Sounds simple enough, right.

91
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:34,147
Some philosophers believe that properties like evenness, size,

92
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:38,095
and shape are irreducible, you can't break them down into other

93
00:04:38,095 --> 00:04:41,120
simpler, more primary properties.

94
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,715
There are philosophers, obviously,

95
00:04:42,715 --> 00:04:45,237
that disagree with that, and so you have that conversation.

96
00:04:45,237 --> 00:04:47,296
But when you think about a simple property,

97
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:50,135
if you can't break it down into other constituent parts then

98
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:52,753
you're kind of dealing with the basic property that you

99
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,225
wanna talk about, all right?

100
00:04:54,225 --> 00:04:56,537
So think about something like color.

101
00:04:56,537 --> 00:05:00,245
Is redness a simple property or a complex property?

102
00:05:00,245 --> 00:05:02,725
When you think about redness you can talk about its hue,

103
00:05:02,725 --> 00:05:07,015
you can talk about what type of red it is, how bright it is,

104
00:05:07,015 --> 00:05:07,825
things like that.

105
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:10,855
So it might be actually not a simple property.

106
00:05:10,855 --> 00:05:13,055
It might be something that we're gonna talk about next,

107
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:14,815
which is called a complex property.

108
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,120
Now, given this definition of a simple property,

109
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,670
then, a complex property is just a property that

110
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,690
has other properties that are part of it, okay?

111
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:29,110
One that you can talk about in terms of other things.

112
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,150
If you have other adjectives or nouns that apply to the property

113
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,572
you're talking about, then it's not a simple property.

114
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:37,720
All right I used the example here of a mammal.

115
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,850
A mammal can be reduced to other properties.

116
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:43,920
So that means it itself is not simple.

117
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,521
It's in the class of things that are alive,

118
00:05:46,521 --> 00:05:50,247
it's in the class of things that give birth to live offspring,

119
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:53,764
right, those are all the other properties that we would put

120
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:55,820
into this idea of a mammal.

121
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:57,220
All right, so, properties,

122
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,480
simple and complex, these are fairly straightforward ideas.

123
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,870
And again, as you get into the module on categorical logic,

124
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,200
you're gonna see how these concepts play into how Aristotle

125
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,020
thought about constructing his logical system.

126
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:13,780
And then I would like you to think about how you relate that

127
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,210
to the syllogistic logic,

128
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,260
the propositional logic we looked at earlier in the course.

129
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,840
And there are similarities, but you can see that Aristotle's

130
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,380
approach takes a very distinctive perspective and

131
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,040
this idea of properties plays into that

132
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,169
heavily as you'll go through this.

133
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:34,300
I'm gonna give you one more lesson on properties and

134
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,090
how properties are used.

135
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,980
We tend to use properties in a very important concept in

136
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:43,390
philosophy and logic called the Theory of Identity, or

137
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:45,540
the Philosophy of Identity.

138
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:48,500
Identity is important because it helps you distinguish

139
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,480
between things.

140
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:52,560
It helps you figure out whether two things that you're

141
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,610
considering are the same thing or if they're individualistic.

142
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,772
And I'll give you some examples of where this is really

143
00:06:57,772 --> 00:06:59,100
important in just a moment.

144
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,070
But let's talk through this idea of identity and

145
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,300
how properties are used.

146
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,240
All right, so

147
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:11,780
how do we tell if two things are the same or if they differ?

148
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,810
There was a debate in early astronomy

149
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,020
over the morning star and the evening star.

150
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,790
Hesperus and Phosphorus were their names.

151
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:23,494
And for a long time astronomers believed that they were actually

152
00:07:23,494 --> 00:07:24,457
two different stars.

153
00:07:24,457 --> 00:07:27,742
The morning star you'd see just after sunrise or just

154
00:07:27,742 --> 00:07:32,270
before sunrise, the evening star you'd see just after sunset.

155
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:35,210
And astronomers didn't know that they were

156
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,090
actually the same star.

157
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,830
So they ended up being the same star.

158
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:42,320
They ended up being a planet, I think it's the planet Venus.

159
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:43,660
I have to check on that, but

160
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,460
it was essentially the same celestial body and

161
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,450
they had two different names, two different identities, but

162
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:55,170
at the end of the day it ended up being the same planet.

163
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,880
So when they talked about it,

164
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,570
they had to change their thinking, they had to change

165
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:02,470
the way that they referred to that celestial body.

166
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:03,490
So how do you tell?

167
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,301
How do you know if a thing is the same,

168
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,766
two things are the same or if they're different?

169
00:08:10,395 --> 00:08:13,575
So identity does serve this role in our philosophy, right.

170
00:08:13,575 --> 00:08:16,708
If we can come up with a criterion If we can come up with

171
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:19,914
a rule that helps us distinguish between two things,

172
00:08:19,914 --> 00:08:23,760
then it's gonna allow us to have that conversation in a much more

173
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,430
profitable way.

174
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,400
We can now,

175
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,810
as we're debating over whether two things are the same or

176
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,630
different, we have a rule that we can put into play here.

177
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:37,120
Here's some areas of philosophy where this ends up being

178
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,250
very important.

179
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,180
Are the mind and the brain the same thing?

180
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:42,255
Philosophers debate this all the time, and

181
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:44,790
this is a very interesting, even current, debate.

182
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:46,735
When we're talking about the brain,

183
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,298
are we talking about the mind, and vice-versa?

184
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:53,365
Is color the same thing as a bandwidth of light hitting your

185
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:54,980
retina?

186
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:58,580
There's a science behind visualizing color.

187
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:03,340
But is the color that you see, the redness that you see,

188
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:07,392
the same thing as that science of light waves and

189
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:11,154
retinas and how those two things interact?

190
00:09:11,154 --> 00:09:13,510
Then we can talk about things even like this.

191
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,550
This is a great philosophical topic.

192
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,480
How do we talk about equality when it comes to humans?

193
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,704
Is the humanist that the person sitting next to you or

194
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:26,342
your family member or a loved one, is their

195
00:09:26,342 --> 00:09:29,876
humanness the same as your humanness or is it different?

196
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:31,480
Everybody's certainly different.

197
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,805
We all have a variety of different properties.

198
00:09:34,805 --> 00:09:36,740
We've that term that we looked at earlier.

199
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,020
We're all different heights and

200
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,110
weights and different skin color and hair color.

201
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:42,360
So what makes us equal?

202
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,690
What part of our humanness is equal, if any part?

203
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,710
And the philosophy of identity helps us talk through that.

204
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:55,365
So there was a philosopher named Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz

205
00:09:55,365 --> 00:09:58,714
that gave us a rule, gave us a pattern, for

206
00:09:58,714 --> 00:10:03,570
talking about identity and we're gonna look at his rule now.

207
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,050
This rule is widely accepted across both science and

208
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:10,698
philosophy and so it's a good thing to learn and know.

209
00:10:10,698 --> 00:10:14,450
So let's talk about Leibniz identity.

210
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:18,075
So Leibniz said, take any two things that you're talking

211
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:22,425
about, the mind and the brain or Hesperus and Phosphorus.

212
00:10:22,425 --> 00:10:24,935
Each of these things has a set of properties that

213
00:10:24,935 --> 00:10:25,495
are true of them.

214
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,915
Complex and simple properties that are true of them.

215
00:10:27,915 --> 00:10:30,351
So we're gonna take both things, the mind and the brain.

216
00:10:30,351 --> 00:10:35,420
And he said take all of the properties of those two things.

217
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:37,950
So let's take the mind in the brain.

218
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:41,254
Well, actually that's probably a too complicated of entity.

219
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:43,330
So we wanna talk about it.

220
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:45,920
Let's talk about Hesperus and Phosphorus.

221
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,590
These are the morning star and the evening star.

222
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:52,180
So if we take those two objects, and we list their properties,

223
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:55,230
their brightness, their location in the sky,

224
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,890
the movement of the planet through the sky over time.

225
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:04,210
We look at all of those properties that are true of each

226
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:06,530
body, each of the celestial bodies, Hesperus and

227
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,070
Phosphorus and

228
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:11,070
we ask, is there any property that's different between them?

229
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,540
That's the rule.

230
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,550
Is there any single property?

231
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:18,010
It doesn't matter how small it is.

232
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,270
Is there any single property that's different between the two

233
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:23,710
bodies and we look at that list?

234
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,240
If there is a property that's different

235
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,760
then the two objects are different.

236
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,390
It's the property that distinguishes between the two

237
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:34,340
objects.

238
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,950
It's a property difference.

239
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:39,370
If there's a single property, it doesn't matter how small it is,

240
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,370
that it's different between Hesperus and

241
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:45,240
Phosphorus, we're talking about two different planetary bodies.

242
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,163
If there is no difference between the two celestial bodies

243
00:11:48,163 --> 00:11:50,371
then we're talking about the same object,

244
00:11:50,371 --> 00:11:52,293
we're talking about the same thing.

245
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:56,408
And what we would say is those two objects are identical to

246
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:57,840
each other.

247
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,760
They're not two objects,

248
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,109
they're only two in name rather than in reality or ontology.

249
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:07,146
They're all wrongly referring to them as two things,

250
00:12:07,146 --> 00:12:09,200
when in reality there's one thing.

251
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,260
And that's the distinction.

252
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:14,510
Are we making what's called a semantic difference, or

253
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,260
is the difference a real difference?

254
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,930
Are they actually different objects?

255
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,130
And so this is kind of a formal way of writing this out.

256
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:25,425
The way this reads is a is equal to b,

257
00:12:25,425 --> 00:12:28,350
Hesperus is equal to Phosphorus.

258
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,090
If and only if,

259
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:32,700
that double arrow means this is a necessary condition.

260
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,860
We talked about this earlier in the course.

261
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,430
It's necessarily true that for any property,

262
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:41,090
that's what the P means here, for any property, if P

263
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,380
is true of a and P is true of b, then a and b are identical.

264
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,890
If there's a single property difference, then a and

265
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,710
b are not identical.

266
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,065
So start thinking about this and

267
00:12:53,065 --> 00:12:54,955
all the things that you care about,

268
00:12:54,955 --> 00:12:59,265
this is a good way to come up with definitions for things.

269
00:12:59,265 --> 00:13:02,185
Is your humanness the same as the humanness of the person

270
00:13:02,185 --> 00:13:03,165
next to you?

271
00:13:03,165 --> 00:13:04,731
Is the mind and the brain the same thing?

272
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:07,689
Is the color red and the wavelength of light that is

273
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:10,985
hitting your retina, are those identical?

274
00:13:10,985 --> 00:13:13,185
Are there any property difference between those objects

275
00:13:13,185 --> 00:13:14,290
that we're talking about?

276
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,484
And that at least gives us a starting point for

277
00:13:16,484 --> 00:13:19,430
talking about whether there are different things.

278
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:21,340
Again, this is not necessarily a proof,

279
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,920
it doesn't necessarily prove that they're identical, but

280
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,480
it gives us a reason to believe that they're not.

281
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,980
And it gives us a good starting point with which

282
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,070
to discuss that.

283
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,790
That's the philosophy of identity.

284
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:35,821
As I studied philosophy, this has been one of

285
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:38,570
the most important principles that I've learned.

286
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:40,960
It's really helped me make important distinctions.

287
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,050
And, again, you're gonna see this idea as you move through

288
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,170
the module on categorical syllogisms.

289
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:47,690
You're gonna see this idea and

290
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:51,180
the relevance of it permeate the material and how Aristotle

291
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,369
developed his logical system using concepts like this.

292
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:57,430
So let's continue to talk about properties.

293
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:00,944
We have just a couple of more ideas here I wanna give you.

294
00:14:00,944 --> 00:14:04,053
And the next concept that we wanna look at and this directly

295
00:14:04,053 --> 00:14:07,671
relates to categorical logic, is the philosophy of universals and

296
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:10,810
particulars when it comes to properties.

297
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,070
And we're gonna go a little bit off topic and

298
00:14:13,070 --> 00:14:16,050
talk about the Greeks in general here.

299
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,920
The Greeks had a very specific way of viewing properties in

300
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,890
terms of their universality or their particularness.

301
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,030
And so it's important to understand this and when you get

302
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,790
the idea here when we see what Aristotle and Plato were trying

303
00:14:29,790 --> 00:14:32,560
to do, it's gonna help you understand why Aristotle

304
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,500
developed his categorical logic in the way that he did.

305
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,920
So one question that the the early Greeks asked is,

306
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,440
how do properties exist in the world?

307
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,530
Where is humanness after all?

308
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,120
Where is redness?

309
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,460
Where are these properties that we talk about each and

310
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,210
every day, multiple times a day?

311
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,650
How do they exist?

312
00:14:51,650 --> 00:14:54,260
Do they exist in the things that have them or

313
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,750
do they exist in a different way?

314
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,000
And the way that the early Greek's talked about it is

315
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,910
they can exist in two different ways.

316
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:04,749
They can exist as a universal, or

317
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:08,298
they can exist as a particular, and again this directly relates

318
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:11,140
to this categorical logic that we're looking at.

319
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:13,717
Let me go to the next section here.

320
00:15:13,717 --> 00:15:17,053
So the early Greek philosophers talked about

321
00:15:17,053 --> 00:15:18,896
the individual things,

322
00:15:18,896 --> 00:15:23,900
the redness of the apple, the blackness of this shirt.

323
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,210
They talked about these individual parts.

324
00:15:26,210 --> 00:15:27,412
And then they said,

325
00:15:27,412 --> 00:15:30,460
it's clearly that there's redness in the apple.

326
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,880
The redness appears to be a part of the apple.

327
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,080
But there's a lot of red things in the world.

328
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,660
So the idea of red seems to be abstracted

329
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:41,330
out of the individual things that have them.

330
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:43,200
There's redness.

331
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,460
And there in there are red objects.

332
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,900
And that's how the Greeks thought about these types of

333
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,230
properties.

334
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:53,837
So the way that they thought about the individual things,

335
00:15:53,837 --> 00:15:58,351
as they said the individual red apple is a particular, or

336
00:15:58,351 --> 00:16:02,596
what they called an instance of this property of red.

337
00:16:02,596 --> 00:16:06,610
That red object is a particular red thing.

338
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:09,210
And we can talk about this at the macro level,

339
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:12,429
complex properties, things that chairs, trees, and

340
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,482
rocks have a whole set of complex and

341
00:16:14,482 --> 00:16:17,310
individual properties and those are instance.

342
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:22,049
Those are particular instances of those properties.

343
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:27,381
But the properties themselves, the abstract version of them,

344
00:16:27,381 --> 00:16:30,651
exists as what are called universals.

345
00:16:30,651 --> 00:16:33,961
And not everybody buys this idea of universals,

346
00:16:33,961 --> 00:16:36,555
sometimes called abstract objects.

347
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:39,502
This is heavily debated in philosophy.

348
00:16:39,502 --> 00:16:43,126
But even if you don't buy that universals exist somewhere,

349
00:16:43,126 --> 00:16:46,679
there's this idea of redness somewhere, you can still buy

350
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:50,444
into the idea that there is an abstract, even if it's mental,

351
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:54,060
even if it's a cognitive trick that we're playing.

352
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,022
There is this idea of red that stands over and

353
00:16:57,022 --> 00:17:00,318
above the individual things that have redness.

354
00:17:00,318 --> 00:17:03,030
So we can talk about redness as a category.

355
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,540
And that's where this whole idea of categorical logic comes

356
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,450
from, right?

357
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:09,200
We have these categories, we have these universals

358
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,000
that we can talk about in broad classes of things, okay?

359
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,120
So let's take this simple apple.

360
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,730
This is just kind of a corny example of how this works.

361
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:22,673
We have the form, right, or the universal.

362
00:17:22,673 --> 00:17:27,126
The other term for this is a form and token or

363
00:17:27,126 --> 00:17:29,361
form an individual.

364
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:31,030
We have the form apple, right?

365
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,810
It exists as a universal.

366
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:36,742
And then we have all the instances.

367
00:17:36,742 --> 00:17:41,735
We have all the individual apples that exemplify

368
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:45,650
the properties of that thing, okay?

369
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:49,194
So that's how Aristotle thought about, and

370
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:53,578
Plato thought about the relationship between forms and

371
00:17:53,578 --> 00:17:56,948
tokens, or universals and particulars.

372
00:17:56,948 --> 00:17:59,981
All right, let's talk a little bit more about universals cuz

373
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:03,014
it's gonna be very important to understand this concept as we

374
00:18:03,014 --> 00:18:04,494
get into categorical logic.

375
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:08,218
All right, for some of the Greeks, Plato in particular,

376
00:18:08,218 --> 00:18:12,018
Plato thought that universals actually existed outside of

377
00:18:12,018 --> 00:18:16,090
the instances, outside of the things that had them.

378
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:19,470
So for example, if every red object in the world were to

379
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:24,110
disappear, redness, as a universal, would still exist.

380
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:27,030
That's what Plato thought, okay?

381
00:18:27,030 --> 00:18:30,469
So he thought that universals were neither temporal nor

382
00:18:30,469 --> 00:18:31,133
spatial.

383
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:33,460
They did have to exist in the physical world.

384
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,370
He also had very specific views.

385
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,980
And by the way Aristotle didn't share a lot of these.

386
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,440
He also thought that universals could be thought

387
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,930
of as a type or an archetype of the thing.

388
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,630
So if you wanna understand what the properties of a universal

389
00:18:52,630 --> 00:18:57,440
are, you have to take all of the instances, and think about

390
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,720
what those instances share, right, in terms of identity.

391
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,620
And then you can come up with all the properties of

392
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,150
that universal, right?

393
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:11,310
So the type informs what each of the tokens,

394
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:14,570
what each of the individual, particular things, have.

395
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,340
Right, the universe can be thought of a property,

396
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,740
particularly if you have, obviously, a simple property.

397
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,522
But you can have complex properties also that

398
00:19:24,522 --> 00:19:25,625
are universals.

399
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:31,982
And one way to talk about these things is to talk about them as

400
00:19:31,982 --> 00:19:37,080
abstract objects, and we use the suffix ness.

401
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,610
We put ness after it, like redness, blackness.

402
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:44,110
You can even have the property of humanness, right?

403
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,440
Or appleness, whatever the thing's nature is.

404
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,520
So when you are talking about a thing's nature,

405
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:52,391
you really are talking about that universal abstraction,

406
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,640
all right?

407
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,740
So universals then are the starting point.

408
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:58,170
That's how the Greeks thought about properties,

409
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:00,380
as these abstract objects.

410
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:00,880
And then again,

411
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,710
the particulars are the things that possess them.

412
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,030
So if you have the property,

413
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,680
the universal property of redness and you have a red

414
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,740
apple, the red apple, the instance that particular

415
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:17,470
thing participates in the universal by having red, okay?

416
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:19,780
So let's talk about these particulars.

417
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,815
Particulars then are instances or instantiations.

418
00:20:22,815 --> 00:20:24,940
Don' t let these big words bother you.

419
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,000
It just means the particular takes the universal and

420
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,230
it exemplifies it.

421
00:20:30,230 --> 00:20:33,900
It has it as a part of what it is, okay?

422
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,560
It instantiates it.

423
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,540
Particulars themselves are in time and space.

424
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,590
They're in the real world, right?

425
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,300
They're things that we can touch.

426
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,030
You can hold an apple, you can eat an apple.

427
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,770
You can taste an apple, you can participate in all of its

428
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:47,440
properties in a physical way.

429
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,450
So they have being in time and space, the Greeks thought, okay?

430
00:20:53,450 --> 00:20:55,880
The word that the Greeks used for particulars is token.

431
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,170
Again, type is used for universal, token is used for

432
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:04,420
particular and it's the concrete instance of that thing, right?

433
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,760
Now this last concept is important for the Greeks.

434
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,370
Again, as I mentioned earlier, the Greeks thought that

435
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:14,960
the individual particular thing participates in the universal.

436
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,590
Plato particularly thought this.

437
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:20,620
He thought that if the universal went away, all the instances,

438
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,790
all the particulars would go away with it.

439
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:25,740
If redness, if God got rid of redness,

440
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:29,300
he thought, as a universal,

441
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,170
then all the particular red things would cease to exist.

442
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:35,110
Aristotle had a little bit of a different take.

443
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:38,950
His view was that the particular things, all the red apples and

444
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:40,680
the red objects in the world,

445
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,980
are what made the universal what it is.

446
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,660
So the universal in a sense is created by the fact that

447
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,550
the particulars exist.

448
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,310
And that's where we kinda get this idea that the universal is

449
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:54,140
an abstraction or an idea that's created out of all

450
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,880
the particulars that we see in the world.

451
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,800
But those details aren't terribly important for

452
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:01,530
understanding how categories work in categorical logic.

453
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,490
The important part is that we have these distinctions between

454
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,850
the universal, the category, the class.

455
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:08,460
Sometimes we use class.

456
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,270
You have classes of mammals, right?

457
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,820
You have classes of birds, you have classes of human, right?

458
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:17,490
Those classes exist, and then you have the particular things

459
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:20,140
in that class, the particular instances,

460
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,790
the individual humans walking around,

461
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:24,940
the individual birds flying around, those kinds of things.

462
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,454
Right, so that's the relationship between

463
00:22:27,454 --> 00:22:29,446
the universal and the particular.

464
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:32,020
All right, all of this background again is to help

465
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:35,420
inform how Aristotle thought about categorical logic.

466
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:37,560
And he uses these concepts and

467
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:40,440
builds a logical system around these concepts.

468
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:43,650
And the more you understand how these concepts work, the better

469
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,950
you're gonna be at understanding how categorical logic works.

470
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,060
And when you get to the section on how categorical statements

471
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,300
are designed and developed, these ideas should make a lot

472
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,490
more sense to you as you put those statements together.

473
00:22:58,632 --> 00:23:01,010
All right, I wanna give you one more lesson on Aristotle's

474
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:04,230
ontology and then we'll be done with this topic and we

475
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:08,580
can move on to actually working with categorical statements.

476
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:14,290
Aristotle's ontology included a methodology.

477
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:17,659
And that methodology, the method that he used to examine

478
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:21,376
the world and study the world, the scientific method we know it

479
00:23:21,376 --> 00:23:25,025
as today, and we're gonna talk about how Aristotle actually

480
00:23:25,025 --> 00:23:27,293
developed that method in the course.

481
00:23:27,293 --> 00:23:31,350
But Aristotle came out with this idea of four causes.

482
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,200
And what he said is, you really can't understand something

483
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,060
unless you understand its four causes.

484
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:40,130
Now he doesn't mean causes in a way that we mean cause and

485
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:43,450
effect, the thing that created it or the thing that started it.

486
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,249
What he means is when we wanna understand its four causes,

487
00:23:47,249 --> 00:23:50,049
we wanna understand its four components.

488
00:23:50,049 --> 00:23:52,157
Everything has four components,

489
00:23:52,157 --> 00:23:55,800
and those components are what inform how we understand it.

490
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,185
That's what he meant by cause.

491
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,210
Iit's more of an informational idea

492
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,420
rather than a cause effect idea.

493
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,190
All right, and he said understand these four causes

494
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:06,960
if you wanna understand how anything is made up.

495
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,740
The way that he categorizes these

496
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,980
is really really fascinating, and

497
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:13,510
I wanna try to show you why it's fascinating in a moment.

498
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:16,580
But again, this directly informs categorical logic, and

499
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,850
why his logic was developed in the way that it was.

500
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:22,670
His first cause, he said, is the material cause.

501
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,960
So let's take our red apple again.

502
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,920
We've got a red apple, and

503
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,740
we want to understand what that red apple is.

504
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,420
We want to scientifically study it, all right?

505
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:35,610
One thing we have to understand first is what is it made up of?

506
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,240
We wanna tear it apart scientifically.

507
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:41,220
And now we can do really complex chemical analyses

508
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:42,740
of these objects, right?

509
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,480
So we can look at the chemical make up.

510
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,660
We can weigh it.

511
00:24:45,660 --> 00:24:47,184
We can measure its size.

512
00:24:47,184 --> 00:24:49,047
We can look at all the other apples and

513
00:24:49,047 --> 00:24:51,763
talk about what's identical between them, right?

514
00:24:51,763 --> 00:24:53,952
But we have to understand the stuff of the thing.

515
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:56,942
We have to understand the material Make up of the object

516
00:24:56,942 --> 00:24:58,244
that we're studying.

517
00:24:58,244 --> 00:25:00,790
And he said this is true of anything that we want to study.

518
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,720
We have to understand the material cause.

519
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,440
All right, simple enough.

520
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:08,295
The next one relates directly to our topic of universals in

521
00:25:08,295 --> 00:25:09,740
particulars.

522
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:12,900
So Aristotle said, if you want to understand something,

523
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,460
you have to understand what class it belongs to.

524
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:20,570
You have to understand what he called its formal cause, or,

525
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:24,300
remember we used the term the form of the thing, right?

526
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:28,730
The ideal, the necessary properties that that thing has.

527
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,820
And this goes back to identity, right?

528
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,880
The identity and property talk.

529
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,010
You have to understand what property or what properties

530
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:41,310
the object has that's identical to other things in its class.

531
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:43,700
So let's take the idea of a chair,

532
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,400
you're probably sitting in one right now.

533
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,870
If not, you can look around the room and

534
00:25:48,870 --> 00:25:51,930
probably see a couple of different types of chairs.

535
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:54,720
All right, now, when I use the term chair,

536
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,110
I'm using a categorical term, aren't I?

537
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,090
I'm using a class of things,

538
00:25:59,090 --> 00:26:04,020
I'm saying this individual object belongs to a class

539
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:08,610
of things that also participate in that class, all right?

540
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:11,340
The individuals participate in that class.

541
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,020
So what Aristotle would ask is,

542
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,920
what are the properties that all, and only chairs,

543
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:21,740
possess that makes them a part of that class?

544
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:23,470
Let's think about that for a moment.

545
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:27,779
If we have an object and it has a round thing at the top and

546
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:32,183
three legs coming out, we tend not to call that a chair,

547
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:34,551
we call that a stool, right?

548
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:36,825
There's something missing we might say,

549
00:26:36,825 --> 00:26:38,220
it's not really a chair.

550
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,320
So we would say that a chair has to have probably something

551
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:41,910
to sit on.

552
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:46,520
Most of us would probably define a chair as having a back, so

553
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,720
something to rest your back against.

554
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,210
And most chairs that people sit in have four legs.

555
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:55,760
Let's just start there, so we have something to sit on,

556
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,920
something to support the back and four legs, and

557
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,640
we'll say those are the necessary properties

558
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,220
that chairs have and all chairs have.

559
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,270
There's not a single exception to our definition.

560
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,190
Now, we can debate this, this is just for

561
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:11,550
the purpose of giving you an example.

562
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,280
Let's talk about some other properties that chairs

563
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:15,740
must have.

564
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,790
Can they be this big?

565
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:21,460
Can they be two inches tall, in other words?

566
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,680
Probably not gonna work as a chair, right?

567
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:26,500
Because now it doesn't perform its function,

568
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,552
it's not functioning as a chair.

569
00:27:28,552 --> 00:27:32,444
So we would say a chair has to be at least as big to hold up

570
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:35,657
a human person, either a child or an adult.

571
00:27:35,657 --> 00:27:39,150
Can the chair be made out of whipped cream or

572
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:41,398
something solid, jello?

573
00:27:41,398 --> 00:27:44,340
Probably not, right?

574
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,940
Again, chairs have to accomplish some goal,

575
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,260
they have to do something, and

576
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:51,730
a chair made up of whipped cream is a gonna function as a chair.

577
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:54,240
Can be shape like a chair, can look like a chair, but

578
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,080
it's not going to be a chair.

579
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,480
Okay, hopefully you see the idea.

580
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:00,810
So chairs have necessary properties,

581
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,920
all chairs have to have them.

582
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,870
And then individual chairs have those properties

583
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:08,275
as a part of that instance, that particular thing.

584
00:28:08,275 --> 00:28:12,640
But we can abstract all those universal properties of a chair

585
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,900
and say now this is what is in the class of chair.

586
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,630
And philosophers, and logicians, and

587
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:21,090
scientist spend a lot of time debating what should be in and

588
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:23,000
what should be out of these classes.

589
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,380
This is how we come up with classifications in

590
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,950
biology, right?

591
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:29,880
You figure out what a species has to have, and then you say

592
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,710
if something doesn't have it, it's not a part of that species.

593
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:36,780
That classification exercise is being done all the time.

594
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:39,535
And so the formal cause was really, really important for

595
00:28:39,535 --> 00:28:42,138
Aristotle, if you truly wanna understand something.

596
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,430
And he spends a lot of time emphasizing and

597
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,310
play the do as well, the importance of the formal cause.

598
00:28:48,470 --> 00:28:51,580
So the formal cause is the ideal the form of the thing,

599
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,909
it's necessary properties.

600
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:57,390
Aristotle said, we also need to understand its efficient cause,

601
00:28:57,390 --> 00:29:01,040
and put simply, this is just what brings the thing about.

602
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,260
So think about any object that you want to study.

603
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,420
It's always helpful to know how it came about,

604
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,650
how it came to be, what brought it about.

605
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,700
And this could be a human maker,

606
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,990
if I hold up this mouse, if you look at this mouse, we would say

607
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,960
engineers build this mouse, they're the efficient cause.

608
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,420
The engineers are what brought the thing into being.

609
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,872
The term that logicians like to use is that by means of which

610
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:28,073
something exists.

611
00:29:28,073 --> 00:29:31,220
What brought it into existence?

612
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:37,705
And then finally, ironically, we have the final cause.

613
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:40,826
And this is the last thing that Aristotle said,

614
00:29:40,826 --> 00:29:44,886
you needed to understand if you want to understand everything

615
00:29:44,886 --> 00:29:46,890
about the object.

616
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:50,410
The final cause is the why that that for

617
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:53,240
the sake of which something exists.

618
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,840
Now this might strike you as a little odd.

619
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,570
Why do we care about the why?

620
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,542
The purpose of the thing?

621
00:29:58,542 --> 00:30:02,198
The term that the early Greeks used was teleology,

622
00:30:02,198 --> 00:30:05,599
or the goal for why the thing was brought about,

623
00:30:05,599 --> 00:30:09,952
why did the efficient cause bring the thing into existence.

624
00:30:09,952 --> 00:30:14,355
Now notice the important relationship between final cause

625
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,770
and formal cause.

626
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,500
We cannot come up with the necessary properties of

627
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:23,690
the thing until we understand why the thing exist.

628
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,550
Remember we said that whipped cream would be a really bad

629
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,390
material for a chair?

630
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,120
And the reason for that is because the chair exist for

631
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,380
the purpose of holding someone's weight,

632
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,240
allowing someone to sit down.

633
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,730
So if we didn't know that, we couldn't tell

634
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,930
that the chair could not be made out of wood frame.

635
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,990
We couldn't make that statement because we would have no idea

636
00:30:44,990 --> 00:30:47,550
for the purpose of the chair.

637
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:50,040
So the final cause, Aristotle and

638
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:52,880
Plato thought, is super important to understand if

639
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,970
you're gonna understand what the formal cause is all about,

640
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,220
what its necessary properties are for that thing.

641
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:03,274
So Aristotle said, if you wanna understand something fully,

642
00:31:03,274 --> 00:31:05,881
you have to understand its final cause.

643
00:31:05,881 --> 00:31:06,382
And again,

644
00:31:06,382 --> 00:31:08,896
this is gonna be important as you study categorical logic.

645
00:31:08,896 --> 00:31:11,385
Cuz as you come up with categories of things,

646
00:31:11,385 --> 00:31:14,399
as you make universal all and particular statements,

647
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,676
all statements and some statements, you're gonna have to

648
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:21,085
understand the relationship of the particular properties to

649
00:31:21,085 --> 00:31:24,210
the categories of the things that you're discussing.

650
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:27,720
So this is Aristotle's four cause model.

651
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,740
And again, this informed a lot of Western philosophy in modern

652
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:34,930
scientific methodology.

653
00:31:34,930 --> 00:31:37,580
So a lot of the methods that we use in modern science

654
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:40,590
were built up from Aristotle's basic model.

655
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:41,700
Now, to close out this section,

656
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,940
I just wanna give you a quick illustration.

657
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:47,000
I've been talking about different ideas and ways to

658
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,100
think about this, but let's talk about Aristotle's four causes

659
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,170
as we apply them to a house.

660
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:55,090
So if we're gonna describe the material cause of a house,

661
00:31:55,090 --> 00:31:57,610
we would say things that make it up.

662
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:00,820
The wood, bricks, windows, all the material pieces,

663
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,500
all the stuff that the house is made up of.

664
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,520
Now, the formal cause gets a little tricky.

665
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,490
Remember we have to keep the final cause in mind

666
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:11,120
in order to talk about the formal cause.

667
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,910
So we're gonna say that the house has to have some essential

668
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,930
components, like walls.

669
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:18,330
It probably should have a roof and

670
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:21,230
it should have a door, why does it need a roof?

671
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,630
Well we would say the purpose of a house is shelter.

672
00:32:24,770 --> 00:32:27,290
So if you have a house with no roof, it's not

673
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,040
providing that function, it's not meeting that purpose.

674
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,850
And therefore, fails to fit the category of house,

675
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:33,639
if it doesn't have a roof.

676
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,970
Why do you need doors?

677
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:39,410
Well, again, the purpose of a house is to provide shelter for

678
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,720
humans, right?

679
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,000
We're talking about obviously human built homes here.

680
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,310
It has to provide shelter for humans.

681
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,850
And so if the humans don't have a way to get in and

682
00:32:47,850 --> 00:32:49,850
out, it seizes to function as a house.

683
00:32:49,850 --> 00:32:52,490
Now, it's just a big box with a roof on it.

684
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:57,360
So our final cause, the purpose, has to inform our formal cause,

685
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,620
which is the things that make it up.

686
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,400
And then we have our efficient cause,

687
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,460
we would say builders, architects,

688
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,590
builders, everybody that goes into putting the house up.

689
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:11,250
And then of course the final cause is a dwelling or shelter.

690
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,100
Once we know that the house needs to function as a dwelling

691
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,030
a shelter,

692
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:18,450
then we can come up with a list of the unnecessary properties.

693
00:33:18,450 --> 00:33:21,920
So this is how we might think, this is obviously a very crude,

694
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,330
very high level example of what we're talking about.

695
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:26,980
But you can apply this methodology to anything.

696
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,780
And that's where it becomes really magical,

697
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:31,740
you can take that method and tear something apart, and

698
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:35,680
really understand it by applying Aristotle's four causes to it.

00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:42,000
All right, this provides us with some background with some ideas

700
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,340
of why Aristotle developed this categorical system of logic.

701
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:49,244
And as you go through this module, look for these ideas,

702
00:33:49,244 --> 00:33:52,028
look at how these ideas informed how Aristotle thought

703
00:33:52,028 --> 00:33:52,764
about logic.

704
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,964
And it will help you better understand putting categorical

705
00:33:55,964 --> 00:33:59,164
statements together, and then when you get to categorical

706
00:33:59,164 --> 00:34:01,724
syllogisms, this philosophy will help you and

707
00:34:01,724 --> 00:34:04,042
help inform how you do that in a richer way.
