  <multiplechoiceresponse><p>Examine the following scenario.</p><p>The Bards, a Seattle rock band, need a new sound system. The system must handle four singers, and it must be powerful enough to fill up a school gym. Friends in another band, Jimmy Hanna and the Dynamics, have a brand Z sound system that works well, so the Bards decide to buy a brand Z system. They reason that the brand Z sound system works fine for the Dynamics, so it will probably work fine for the Bards.</p><p>Does the addition of the item below strengthen the argument (S), weaken the argument (W), or leave the strength of the argument unchanged (U)? </p>
The conclusion is broadened to “The sound system will be adequate, although not always perfect.”<br/><br/>
