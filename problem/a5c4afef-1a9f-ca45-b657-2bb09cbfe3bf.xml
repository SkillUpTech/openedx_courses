    <p>Examine this argument:<br/>
Few cats are orange colored. I hear a cat meowing across the street. The cat meowing is probably not orange.<br/></p>
    <label>Does this inductive argument seem to be strong or weak?<br/></label>

        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p/>
        <p>Without any further information, assuming a particular thing is a member of the largest population of that thing (the cat is a member of the class of cats that are not orange given that it's much bigger than the class of cats that are orange) typically is a safe bet.<br/></p>
