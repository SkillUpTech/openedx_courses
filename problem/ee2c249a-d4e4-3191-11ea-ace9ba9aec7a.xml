    <p>Examine this argument:<br/>
A Purdue University study found that rats consumed many more calories and put on weight when they were fed artificial sweeteners before meals. The sweeteners were found to cause powerful urges to eatâ€”urges the rats could not control. The
study was repeated five times, with the same results each time. Humans and rats have similar digestive systems. Therefore, artificial sweeteners probably increase weight in humans as well.<br/></p>

        <p>Explanation</p>
        <p/>
        <p>The data in the argument only gives us grounds to believe that further experimentation on humans is warranted but not that artificial sweeteners have any negative effect on humans.<br/></p>
