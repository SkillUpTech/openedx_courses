<h3>Course Overview and Schedule</h3>

<p>Introduction to Python Unit 1 is an Absolute Beginner course, intend to be a 4-5 week course taking 12 - 16 hours to complete and requires only access to a computer with a modern web browser and an internet connection.  The course is not intended for the experienced programmer.  The student will be introduced to the basic structure of the Python 3 language and be ready to take Unit 2 Fundementals as well as other beginner courses. </p>

<h4>Students</h4>

<p><strong>No experience needed.</strong> DEV236x Introduction to Python: (Unit 1) Absolute Beginner is designed to be accessible to absolute beginners with little to no text based coding experience.  Video is provided for each topic as well as code examples and practice tasks.</p>

<h4>System Requirements</h4>

<p>All learning activities can be done online. All that is needed is a computer with an internet connection and a modern web browser.  </p>

<h4>Schedule</h4>

<p>DEV236x Introduction to Python: (Unit 1) Absolute Beginner is a self-paced course that consists of four instructional modules (1-4). All four of the modules are available when the course begins, and you can work your way through the modules at your own pace.</p>

<p>While each student will complete this course at their own pace, we anticipate that an average beginner student will be able to complete the course instruction and core lab assignments in about 12 - 16 hours (averaging 3-4 hours per module). We recommend that you attempt to complete one module per week, and rather than pushing on to the next module, that you allocate any additional study time that you have (for a particular week) to exploring suggested resources and experimenting with what you've learned during the labs. A slower or faster pace may work well for some students, but we believe that this approach will be effective for most students.  </p>

<p>Module 5 is a Final coding Project (~1 hour). </p>

<h4>Module Structure</h4>

<h5>Modules 1 - 4</h5>

<p>Modules 1-4 contain several sections of Instructional Content (3-9 instructional sections) with Concept Videos, Sample Code, and Practice Tasks.  At the end of the Instructional Content sections are T/F and multiple choice self-check questions (these account for 50% of the grade).  </p>

<p>The last section of each Module contains Practice Content and a <strong>Required</strong> Module level Coding Assignment.  The Practice and Required Coding Assignment have corresponding Jupyter Notebook versions (containing the same content) where you can run examples and complete Tasks. For the verified certificate path, you will need to submit a copy of your Required Code Assignment solution into edX using a Assignment Page in the final section of each Module.  These Assignments make up 20% of the Final Grade.  </p>

<h5>Module 5</h5>

<p>Module 5 contains the Final Coding Assignment which is required for the verified certificate and is 30% of the Final Grade.  </p>
