<h3>Welcome to DEV236x Introduction to Python: (Unit 1) Absolute Beginner</h3>

<p>I want to welcome you to the Introduction to Python course. My name is Eric Camplin and I work for Microsoft and I will be your host for this course. We're very excited to have you join us on your journey to develop your Programming skills. We hope you have an enriching and engaging learning experience.</p>

<p>Before you get started with the course material, please read through the brief overview pages in this unit so you can become oriented to the course structure, the schedule, and how things will work in this course. As always, we welcome your feedback so if something is confusing or doesn't work the way you expect, let us know and we'll do our best to address it. We ask that you use the feedback discussion board in this section to let us know how you're doing.</p>

<p>Also, please take a moment to introduce yourself in the discussion forum in this module.  This helps fellow learners to know a little 
bit more about you and helps make discussions in the course later, a little bit easier.</p>

<p>To begin, click the navigation buttons at the top of this page to read through the introductory material. You'll then be prepared to jump right in!</p>

<p>Again, welcome and thanks for taking this course from Microsoft.</p>
