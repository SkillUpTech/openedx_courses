<h3>Getting Around the Course</h3>

<p><strong>Layout of the course</strong>  </p>

<p>DEV236x is laid out in modules and units. Each module contains multiple units that cover the material for that module. The module is the topic area and the units have all the learning material you'll need to learn that topic. To navigate through the module's units, use the navigation bar at the top of the module. You can use the left and right arrows to move through each unit.  </p>

<p><strong>Course Project Files</strong>  </p>

<p>Each Section has an associated .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) where samples can be run, and where practice tasks and code assignments can be completed.  The Jupyter Notebooks can be found in Module 1, Section 1 in the project files download topic.  </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>Each unit will generally have some video content, reading material and problem sets, and a set of assessment questions to test your knowledge. Some units also have a discussion board where you can post questions and other material so fellow students can provide feedback. The units are meant to be taken in order but you can skip around if you already have mastered the material in a particular unit. In order to do well on the assessments, you should learn the material in all the units. </p>

<p><strong>Instructor feedback</strong>  </p>

<p>Given the nature of this MOOC-style course and the potential large number of students enrolled, its not possible for instructors to provide feedback to students. However, we encourage you to seek help and feedback from your fellow students using the discussion boards. This is a great way to help each other out and enrich your learning experience.</p>
