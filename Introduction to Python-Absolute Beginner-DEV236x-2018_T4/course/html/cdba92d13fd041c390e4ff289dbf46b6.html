<h2 id="considering-sequence">Considering Sequence</h2>
<p>In programming, <strong>sequence</strong> refers to the order that code is processed.  Objects in Python, such as variables and functions, are not available until they have been processed.</p>
<p>Processing sequence flows from the top of a page of code to the bottom. This often means that <strong>Function definitions are placed at the beginning of a page of code.</strong></p>
