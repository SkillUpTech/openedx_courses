<p>Each Section has an associated .ipynb (Jupyter Notebook) where samples can be run, and where practice tasks and code assignments can be completed.  The files are available on this page.</p>
<p>Course Materials for Introduction to Python Unit 1 on edX also come in a Jupyter Notebook format (.ipynb files) that enable the student to:</p>
<ul>
<li>run sample code</li>
<li>code and run the practice Tasks</li>
<li>code and run the unit practices</li>
<li>code and run the code assignments (4 end of unit and 1 final)</li>
</ul>
<p>Notebooks can be cloned or uploaded using Azure Notebooks (<a href="https://aka.ms/edx-dev236x-az" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/edx-dev236x-az</a>) which allows all work to be done and saved via a modern web browser and internet connection.</p>

<p><a href="https://notebooks.azure.com/eric/libraries/DEV236x" target="_blank">https://notebooks.azure.com/eric/libraries/DEV236x</a></p>
<p>Multiple clones will result in multiple copies or may wipe out work so it is recommended to clone once and then log into the Azure Notebooks sites thereafter.</p>
<p>Azure Notebooks (<a href="https://aka.ms/edx-dev236x-az" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/edx-dev236x-az</a>) is recommended to complete coding work as the course is designed using the .ipynb format.  The Jupyter notebook files can be run on a local Python 3 jupyter installation for the adventurous student. Also, students are free to use development environment of their choice with which they are familiar.</p>
