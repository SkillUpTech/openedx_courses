00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,360
Sequence is the order that code runs.

1
00:00:06,361 --> 00:00:08,985
An object needs to be defined before calling.

2
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:14,395
In this example, we have a freshly opened notebook.

3
00:00:14,396 --> 00:00:18,947
first_name is a variable that we want to to assign a name "Alton" and

4
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:22,121
we're just gonna call it with a print function.

5
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:26,880
I get a name error, says 'first_name' is not defined.

6
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:30,830
I need to run this first cell

7
00:00:30,831 --> 00:00:35,640
in order to assign a value to first name and instantiate the variable.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,602
Now that it's been run, I can run the print statement and print Alton.

9
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,740
In the second example I have defined a function hat_available,

10
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:53,109
which takes a single parameter color.

11
00:00:55,545 --> 00:01:00,147
If I run this have_hat which calls hat_available,

12
00:01:00,148 --> 00:01:02,608
I run into the same problem.

13
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:07,410
'hat available' is not defined.

14
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:14,815
I need to first, run the code that defines hat_available.

15
00:01:14,816 --> 00:01:18,046
Once that is run, I can call hat_available.

16
00:01:22,331 --> 00:01:26,909
A NameError is a common error that occurs when you call something

17
00:01:26,910 --> 00:01:28,619
before it's defined.

18
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,308
In other words, you're calling it out of sequence.
