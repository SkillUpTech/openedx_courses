00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,600
Python uses the backslash as and escape sequence.

1
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:11,910
This allows Python to display quotes,

2
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:14,627
backslashes, tabs and new lines.

3
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:20,990
>> Our formating character examples all start with a backslash.

4
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:25,470
Let's start with the Newline Carriage Return formatting

5
00:00:25,471 --> 00:00:27,220
character, \n.

6
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:31,690
This creates a new line in the middle of a string.

7
00:00:31,691 --> 00:00:35,943
So, Hello World is followed by a new line and I am formatting print.

8
00:00:37,876 --> 00:00:44,450
The Tab character, \t Creates a tab in the middle of a string.

9
00:00:44,451 --> 00:00:48,610
Here, I have two tabs to help create a header.

10
00:00:48,611 --> 00:00:49,660
Let's run the code.

11
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,600
We see the two tabs, and

12
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:57,716
then another between the name and the age.

13
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:03,799
To display quotes, I use a backslash, and

14
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,446
then either a double or single quote.

15
00:01:06,447 --> 00:01:11,037
In this example, I want to show a display of quotations around

16
00:01:11,038 --> 00:01:15,290
the text without putting the single quotes around them.

17
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,150
Where this becomes more useful is when I have a long string, and

18
00:01:22,151 --> 00:01:28,780
I want both a single quote, or an apostrophe, and double quotes.

19
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:32,510
The backslash quote, in either single or double,

20
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:33,990
will display the characters.

21
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,654
Here is my apostrophe or single quote and the double quotes.

22
00:01:44,672 --> 00:01:47,958
Sometimes, we just want to show the backslash character.

23
00:01:47,959 --> 00:01:51,040
Use two backslashes.

24
00:01:51,041 --> 00:01:56,713
Double backslash results in a backslash being printed.

25
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:04,981
We can use formatting characters that all start with the escape

26
00:02:04,982 --> 00:02:08,310
sequence backslash to help format our output.
