00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:06,390
The string format methods are really

1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:09,536
useful for display alterations,

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,360
so putting something all upper or all lower title case.

3
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:15,240
Another very useful way to

4
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:18,400
use the string methods is on user input.

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:22,740
Here we have two things going on,

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,679
first of all we're going to use a

7
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:33,239
variable favorite color, fav_color and input as we've seen before and then so

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,840
we're going to apply this lower command

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:39,420
to actually alter what's going to go

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:44,960
into the variable. And so this is a choice this is formatting on input.

11
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,432
So right at the input statement you just

12
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:53,728
use the dot lower to invoke the method

13
00:00:53,770 --> 00:01:00,640
because input will return a string and so you can use the dot lower on a string,

14
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:03,376
so this really is a string right here.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,170
After input returns whatever we put in

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:09,630
there, so let's try running that. So I can

17
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,390
put in my favorite color and I can use

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,369
green and then it prints the favorite

19
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,280
color green and notice my capitalization

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:23,579
is removed because I use the lower and I

21
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:33,712
could use that with upper as well. And I could use blue and we see that I have

22
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:37,109
all caps in that answer.

23
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:41,780
So when do I want to use the

24
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:45,780
String_Formatting and input  I can use it when

25
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:51,152
I'm doing the input or I can just get my input stored in a variable and then

26
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:54,560
I can just alter the variable string in

27
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,648
print statements and in other places and where that could be an advantage is

28
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,960
perhaps later I wanted to see what the

29
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,056
format that was originally used in the string.

30
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,430
So let's go ahead and run that.

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:17,010
so I can go yellow and I can see there

32
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,904
that it prints it all caps, although if I just print it without any

33
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:31,872
string modification and then I see that

34
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,024
yellow is displayed right there. So

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,280
working with the strings input and then

36
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,019
deciding whether I want to modify it

37
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,544
right when I come in and the string is

38
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,079
entered and that's a case where I never

39
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,569
want to change it later or I can modify

40
00:02:51,610 --> 00:03:00,230
it in place in a print statement or in other uses.
