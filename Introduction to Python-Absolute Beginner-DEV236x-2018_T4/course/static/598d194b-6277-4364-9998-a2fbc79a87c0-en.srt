00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:08,140
A simple function can be created with the def keyword,

1
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:14,050
function name, followed by parentheses and a semicolon.

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:19,490
So here we have two simple functions.

3
00:00:19,491 --> 00:00:24,720
And this first one, say hi, we're going to use

4
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:29,330
the keyword def which tells Python we are defining a function and

5
00:00:29,331 --> 00:00:30,590
then we have the function name.

6
00:00:30,591 --> 00:00:32,620
It just has to start with a letter.

7
00:00:32,621 --> 00:00:38,670
We use the standard of lower case and underscore separating words,

8
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:44,290
that is not required, just our standard, and then parenthesis and

9
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:47,985
a colon, and that is your function definition right there.

10
00:00:47,986 --> 00:00:50,418
And then you put code underneath, and

11
00:00:50,419 --> 00:00:54,982
we'll put many different types of pieces of code in our functions, but

12
00:00:54,983 --> 00:00:59,488
right now we're just gonna stick with some simple print statements.

13
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:03,006
The indentation is four spaces.

14
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:07,960
I can then end the function by ending the indentation.

15
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:12,250
So anywhere where either the cell just ends, or

16
00:01:12,251 --> 00:01:14,760
if I put something else in the cell.

17
00:01:14,761 --> 00:01:17,770
And in this case, I'm going to call the function.

18
00:01:17,771 --> 00:01:19,990
And because this indentation has ended,

19
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:24,160
the function only goes to this point here.

20
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:28,000
So to call the function, I use the function name and parenthesis, and

21
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:33,330
then I'm just gonna use this keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter.

22
00:01:33,331 --> 00:01:38,270
And it runs the function which prints these two lines, Hello there,

23
00:01:38,271 --> 00:01:39,530
goodbye.

24
00:01:39,531 --> 00:01:44,270
And then I can look at another example where I can call a function

25
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,020
from another cell.

26
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:50,410
And in this one, three_3_function, it just prints the number 33.

27
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:54,340
I use a def statement to tell Python it's a function.

28
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:59,070
I put a function name, and then I put my parenthesis and colon.

29
00:01:59,071 --> 00:02:02,326
And I add my function definition again, four spaces and

30
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:04,520
then function code.

31
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,970
I need to run the function before I can call it though.

32
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:08,970
Why do I run it?

33
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:10,920
Because that puts it in memory.

34
00:02:10,921 --> 00:02:16,288
Now, this cell can call the function because it's in memory,

35
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:21,252
and I just use the function name followed by parenthesis,

36
00:02:21,253 --> 00:02:22,988
and it prints 33.

37
00:02:22,989 --> 00:02:24,629
So those are simple functions,

38
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:27,190
we'll write many more functions in this course.
