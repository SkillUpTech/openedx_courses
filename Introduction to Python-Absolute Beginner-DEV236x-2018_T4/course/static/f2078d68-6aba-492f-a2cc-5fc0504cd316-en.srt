Common tasks in using the Jupyter Notebook are to set the programming

1
00:00:09,061 --> 00:00:13,550
language, reset the kernel, and insert new cells.

2
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,210
The first item of setting the programming language,

3
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:22,580
we always want our notebook in a Python 3 state.

4
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:28,386
Sometimes they can be in a different version of Python,

5
00:00:28,387 --> 00:00:33,596
such as Python 2 and we see right there that I have it in Python 2.

6
00:00:33,597 --> 00:00:38,000
And what I did to change that is the same thing we're gonna do to get in

7
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:41,012
into Python 3, which is go to the kernel tab,

8
00:00:41,013 --> 00:00:45,820
which is the operating system that runs this Jupyter notebook.

9
00:00:45,821 --> 00:00:49,965
Hit Change kernel, and then choose Python 3.

10
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:56,840
Another common issue with a Jupyter notebook is you might write

11
00:00:56,841 --> 00:01:01,210
some code and it puts the notebook in an unstable state.

12
00:01:01,211 --> 00:01:04,750
Either the browser will become frozen or

13
00:01:04,751 --> 00:01:09,450
the code just is running too long and will not finish.

14
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:14,424
So we reset the kernel, so again we're gonna go to the Kernel menu up

15
00:01:14,425 --> 00:01:17,830
there, and we're gonna either hit Restart or

16
00:01:17,831 --> 00:01:21,608
often you're gonna hit Restart and Clear Output.

17
00:01:21,609 --> 00:01:26,691
And what Clear Output will do is put all of the previously

18
00:01:26,692 --> 00:01:32,872
run code to a starting point so that there is no variables in memory.

19
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:36,637
So I'm just gonna go ahead and push Restart there to show that and

20
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,528
then it asks for confirmation.

21
00:01:38,529 --> 00:01:43,186
Sometimes it will also ask you if you are ready to restart again after

22
00:01:43,187 --> 00:01:45,890
it has to force something to shutdown.

23
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,780
The last item we saw previously is inserting new cells.

24
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:55,654
So, to insert a new cell we know that we can

25
00:01:55,655 --> 00:01:59,008
push both Shift + Enter at the same time.

26
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,933
If it is the last cell, it will add a cell at the bottom, but

27
00:02:02,934 --> 00:02:06,620
if you're in a middle cell, if you hit Shift+Enter,

28
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:10,168
it just runs the cell and then moves to the next cell.

29
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:16,250
And we may want to have a cell where I have x set up here and

30
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:21,273
I have z with a variable over there and I go,

31
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,784
I forgot y and so, I wanna insert a cell.

32
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:31,948
Well there is the Insert menu and I can insert a cell above or below.

33
00:02:31,949 --> 00:02:35,325
In this case, I'll do below and

34
00:02:35,326 --> 00:02:41,090
then I can put my y value in there and I can insert a cell.

35
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,200
So we saw we can change the programming language

36
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:47,950
from the Kernel tab.

37
00:02:47,951 --> 00:02:52,000
With Change kernel, we can also restart and restart and

38
00:02:52,001 --> 00:02:57,430
clear all the output using the Kernel tab and we can insert

39
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:02,690
new cells using the Insert menu and insert either above or below.
