If you&#39;ve run into some error so far in your programming,

1
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:09,480
congratulations you are a official developer.

2
00:00:09,481 --> 00:00:12,150
Errors are normal part of programming process so

3
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:13,696
we have to learn how to trouble shoot them.

4
00:00:13,697 --> 00:00:18,470
Type errors are when types

5
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:21,510
of different type are not allowed to be combined.

6
00:00:21,511 --> 00:00:25,250
So with addition, you can only combined strings together, and

7
00:00:25,251 --> 00:00:27,630
you can only combine numbers together, but

8
00:00:27,631 --> 00:00:30,420
you can&#39;t combine numbers and strings.

9
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:32,330
We&#39;re gonna take a look at some of those samples.

10
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:38,682
In this example we&#39;re trying to combine the string,

11
00:00:38,683 --> 00:00:43,904
my number is, the string literal with this integer 123.

12
00:00:43,905 --> 00:00:47,861
When you run it you might have seen this error previously,

13
00:00:47,862 --> 00:00:52,000
it says we can&#39;t convert int object to a string implicitly.

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,050
This error means that the Python compiler is expecting to

15
00:00:56,051 --> 00:00:58,250
add another string to the first string.

16
00:00:58,251 --> 00:00:59,790
When it encounters an integer, and

17
00:00:59,791 --> 00:01:02,960
doesn&#39;t know how to convert it to a string, it gives us this error.

18
00:01:02,961 --> 00:01:08,508
So what we can do here is we can change this number into a string.

19
00:01:10,927 --> 00:01:12,550
And then that will run properly.

20
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:18,320
So if you se the type error it&#39;s usually means number and string.

21
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:19,990
It&#39;s the most common way it would work.

22
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:25,130
Another way you could run into this is with a variable assignment.

23
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:28,240
And so in this case my number is an integer.

24
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:36,130
And so now this num_intro where it&#39;s going to introduce the number my

25
00:01:36,131 --> 00:01:39,500
number is 123, we hope that&#39;s going to print out but

26
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:45,160
we know that we can&#39;t add a integer with a strings so we get this error.

27
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:53,346
So again, we have to change from integer to string.

28
00:01:56,194 --> 00:02:00,372
Type errors are cause when there is an illegal operation involving

29
00:02:00,373 --> 00:02:01,410
a type.

30
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:06,120
In examples we saw, we can&#39;t combine integer with a string.

31
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:09,630
Always combine strings with strings to avoid the type error.
