    "Conditionals help us run the flow of our code using", 
    "conditional statements that resolve to true or false.", 
    "We will look at if, else, and pass statements.", 
    ">> The example has an if True statement.", 
    "True is a Boolean keyword.", 
    "So if True will do whatever code is indented below the if statement.", 
    "If it's not true, and in this case it's always true, so", 
    "unless I write false, then we will do the else statement.", 
    "So let's just quickly look at how this works out when I run it.", 
    "So if True, it never gets past if True.", 
    "It prints this if statement after if is True.", 
    "And the statement after if is True.", 
    "To get to the else statement,", 
    "we would have to have whatever's here be not True.", 
    "And so we can actually use these keywords, not and True.",

    "something's Not True.",

    "So I look here, if someone I know, if it's True or", 
    "False, and I should see that nice to meet you.", 
    "And it says nice to meet you.",

    "I really want only one of the conditions to execute.", 
    "What that means is I would only wanna print, how have you been or", 
    "nice to meet you.", 
    "And so if I do not wanna do anything,", 
    "I can just write the word pass.", 
    "And this is a keyword, it turns green.", 
    "And so nothing happens in this case.", 
    "And then if I write True.", 
    "Then it will run the how have you been path.", 
    "So, if statements evaluate if they are True, and", 
    "if Not True they will move to the else statement."
