    "And in there, you can write some simple code like a variable x = 3,", 
    "just like in your math class.", 
    "And you can run those cells, and", 
    "then that variable now has a value 3 associated with it.", 
    "So that when we run the cell to ask what x is,", 
    "we can get an output of 3.", 
    "That's just a simple preview of how we'll use code cells in the course.", 
    "So now we know to log in to notebooks.azure.com with our Windows", 
    "login account, and that we can navigate to our libraries,", 
    "or have a link provided to us, and we can clone libraries.", 
    "Also, we can create notebooks in Python 3.", 
    "And we saw two types of cells, the code cell and the markdown cell."
