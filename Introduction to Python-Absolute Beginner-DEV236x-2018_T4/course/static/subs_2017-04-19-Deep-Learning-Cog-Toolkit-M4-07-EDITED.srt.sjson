    "So I've been alluding to you that parameter", 
    "in the convolution operation where we say padding is equal to", 
    "true or false.", 
    "We get to understand here what that means.", 
    "So let's start here.", 
    "You can see the image of the red, green, and", 
    "the blue image that we have.", 
    "And around it we have laid out an array of zeroes.", 
    "Whenever we do that, that operation is called padding.", 
    "So this set of zeroes that we have added here and here,", 
    "we call it zero padding.", 
    "And what implication does it have?", 
    "What operation does it entail?", 
    "So here is an example of what happens when you do no padding.", 
    "As you'll notice,", 
    "the kernel here cannot step outside the bounds of the image.", 
    "Can only have effectively four locations that", 
    "can be mapped for that corresponding kernel and", 
    "this image shape with no padding.", 
    "Now if you add the zeroes, you have a little bit of better", 
    "control of shape of what the output might look like.", 
    "In other words, in the previous case without padding,", 
    "with no padding, our image became a lot smaller", 
    "when we did the convolution operation.", 
    "But in this case with padding,", 
    "where we have added a set of zeroes around the boundaries,", 
    "you can see that the input image here in orange", 
    "is the same as the output image in green in terms of the size.", 
    "Obviously the values are gonna be different based on whatever", 
    "the convolution operation from that particular kernel with", 
    "respect to the image pixels lying underneath it means.", 
    "So this is with Stride 1, which means that for every image, You", 
    "would just slide to the adjacent value here, by one step.", 
    "Now you can do that with more number of steps, and", 
    "that will be the Stride parameter.", 
    "So in this case, the stride is set to 2, and when you do that", 
    "with a larger stride, your image automatically shrinks.", 
    "Please take a moment to look through these", 
    "animations to convince yourself that that indeed is the case.", 
    "The number of positions where this kernel can move", 
    "with a stride of 2 would be these smaller number of", 
    "pixels in the output compared to the input image here.", 
    "Now, with these padding operations,", 
    "our convolution operation for", 
    "the entire image is animated here.", 
    "Again, there's a good reference of the Stanford GitHub site", 
    "that you can refer.", 
    "But do take a moment to convince yourself that indeed these", 
    "animations are reflective of your understanding of", 
    "the convolution operations that we have described in this video."
