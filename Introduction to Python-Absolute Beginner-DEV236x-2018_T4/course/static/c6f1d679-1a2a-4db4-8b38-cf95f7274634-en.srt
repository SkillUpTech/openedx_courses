0
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:06,520
Before we get into recurrence, let's take a step back and

1
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:11,520
start from the problem that we started this module with.

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,550
Which was trying to forecast the output of a solar panel

3
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,080
based on the average temperature of a given day.

4
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,730
So, in this case we had fitted a line to our

5
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,740
observed data points in black dots here.

6
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:29,288
And for

7
00:00:29,288 --> 00:00:33,678
any arbitrary day say this was the average temperature,

8
00:00:33,678 --> 00:00:38,262
we can record the corresponding output of the solar panel.

9
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:42,282
This was our model, say that arbitrary day was Monday, and we

10
00:00:42,282 --> 00:00:46,381
are able to record the Monday's average day temperature, and

11
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:50,246
we fit a model that was able to predict what could be the solar

12
00:00:50,246 --> 00:00:51,978
panel output for Monday.

13
00:00:51,978 --> 00:00:57,390
Now, wouldn't it be nice, if we are able to additionally

14
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:02,260
feed some information regarding the previous day's temperature,

15
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:07,620
say the output of the solar panel on Sunday?

16
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,796
If it is summer,

17
00:01:08,796 --> 00:01:12,912
it's very likely that this value would have a great deal of

18
00:01:12,912 --> 00:01:17,042
influence in what the value predicted on Monday would be.

19
00:01:17,042 --> 00:01:19,000
Now how can you make this happen?

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,266
You could conceptually think of building something which pulls

21
00:01:25,266 --> 00:01:30,434
the data from history, which is the output value of day minus 1.

22
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:33,360
So in the current let's see how that happens.
