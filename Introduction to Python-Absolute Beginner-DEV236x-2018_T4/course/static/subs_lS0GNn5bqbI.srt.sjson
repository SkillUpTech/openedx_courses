    "We'll talk a little bit more about the database, but",

    "digits in this course.", 
    "The model, as the name of module suggests,", 
    "is gonna be logistic regression.", 
    "Some of you might be very familiar with binary", 
    "logistic regression, which is two classes.", 
    "In this case,", 
    "we will do multiple classes which means that obviously,", 
    "the number of digits that we have range from 0 to 9.",

    "some of the concepts that you're gonna learn", 
    "here are gonna be loss and mini batches.",

    "then the last one is gonna be a recurring theme.", 
    "Every module you will see, there's gonna be a train, test,", 
    "predict, workflow which will show you how you can", 
    "combine different components together.", 
    "Almost like a Lego-like composability to", 
    "build this application end to end, train a model and", 
    "then test it out, and be ready to do predictions with them."
