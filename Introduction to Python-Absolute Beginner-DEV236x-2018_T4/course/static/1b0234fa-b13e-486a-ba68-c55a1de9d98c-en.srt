Working with strings and string variables

1
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:09,270
we've accomplished a lot.

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,160
Still we're a little bit limited, so let's look at adding input

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:15,240
and so we're going to use the input statement.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:21,910
So, right here, I have the input statement, as the second line

5
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:27,890
and I'm going to assign small int a new variable to the input.

6
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:31,930
And before that we have a message, which is telling the user,

7
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:34,200
enter a small int or integer.

8
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,860
So, let's see how that works.

9
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,070
So now, it asks me to enter small int.

10
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,040
And so now, I can put a small integer in there,

11
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:44,530
and I think 3 is pretty small. So I enter that in

12
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,670
and now I've populated this variable

13
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:52,620
small int with 3, and so, I'm going to go ahead

14
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:54,800
and print the output

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,930
and if I go to the cell below,

16
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:00,090
I also have access to the small int variable

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:01,760
because in a Jupyter notebook,

18
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:06,200
any variable, any object, that is created

19
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:10,470
in a cell, once it's created, it's available to all the cells.

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:14,210
So now I can go ahead and run this cell and it says

21
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,360
the small int is 3. So that works.

22
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,760
So, let's go ahead and try it again.

23
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:23,990
I'll put in a different number 5, and so now

24
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,760
I've re-populated the small integer variable

25
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,930
and I see 5 below there.

26
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:34,510
So, working with input, we can populate variables with strings

27
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:36,310
and use them in our programs.
