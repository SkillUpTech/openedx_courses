00:00:03,488 --> 00:00:07,390
Python contains all of the basic math operators.

1
00:00:07,391 --> 00:00:08,950
Not just addition, which we've seen,

2
00:00:08,951 --> 00:00:12,010
but also subtraction, multiplication, and division.

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,180
Let's review the basic math operators built

4
00:00:16,181 --> 00:00:18,030
into the Python language.

5
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:23,984
The + sign for addition, the dash or- sign for subtraction, the * for

6
00:00:23,985 --> 00:00:29,670
multiplication and the / also known as forward slash for division.

7
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:33,580
We do the math in a cell or in a console environment.

8
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:35,696
We can just echo that right to the screen.

9
00:00:35,697 --> 00:00:38,911
So let's look at 3 + 5.

10
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,420
And we can run that and it will give us our answer right there.

11
00:00:42,421 --> 00:00:46,310
We also can use order of operations.

12
00:00:46,311 --> 00:00:50,165
Things inside of parentheses are evaluated before things

13
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,452
that are outside of parentheses.

14
00:00:52,453 --> 00:00:59,480
So 3 + 7 times the parentheses.

15
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:03,081
First thing to be evaluated will be the parentheses.

16
00:01:03,082 --> 00:01:05,127
So that was 8 we saw.

17
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:08,467
And then the multiplication * 7.

18
00:01:08,468 --> 00:01:09,845
And then + 3.

19
00:01:13,478 --> 00:01:17,726
So we see that 7 * 8 is 56.

20
00:01:17,727 --> 00:01:20,178
And plus 3 is 59.

21
00:01:24,193 --> 00:01:28,860
We can also evaluate math inside of a print statement.

22
00:01:28,861 --> 00:01:31,775
So we see here an example of using multiplication.

23
00:01:34,423 --> 00:01:37,091
Division, which will always result in a float.

24
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,875
Here we have order of operations with parentheses first and

25
00:01:43,876 --> 00:01:45,480
then multiplication.

26
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,421
Here we have three statements of addition and subtraction.

27
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,984
Again, order of operations, multiplication will happen first.

28
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:05,400
In the other order, multiplication will happen first, 5 * 10.

29
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:08,404
And then,

30
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:14,220
we have a case where we will do two sets of parenthesis evaluated first.

31
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,070
And then they will be multiplied.

32
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,533
So let's check that one.

33
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:21,855
3- 1 should be 2.

34
00:02:21,856 --> 00:02:26,254
22 * 3 should be 66, so let's look over here.

35
00:02:26,255 --> 00:02:31,639
It's 2 * 66 and we get 132.

36
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,178
We can use all of the basic math operators to create equations

37
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:38,053
inside of our programs.
