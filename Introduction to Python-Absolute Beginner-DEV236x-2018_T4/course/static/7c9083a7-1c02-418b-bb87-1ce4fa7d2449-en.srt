0
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:04,120
Before we get into the modeling side of things,

1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:07,660
let's understand what the data looks like.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,470
As I mentioned in the current networks, modeling and

3
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,050
model capacity is important to better understand what it

4
00:00:17,050 --> 00:00:21,320
takes to encapsulate the knowledge that comes from

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,630
combining inputs with the corresponding history.

6
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:28,920
It's also important to recognize what the data is and what

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,810
the format would look like and how to feed it into the model.

8
00:00:32,810 --> 00:00:35,160
So let's take a closer look at the ATIS data.

9
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,780
This data comes from human computer queries from

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,870
Air Travel Information Services.

11
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,580
There are 943 unique words,

12
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,410
we'll also refer to that as the vocabulary.

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:56,697
So when I said show flight from Burbank to Seattle on a day,

14
00:00:56,697 --> 00:01:03,500
each of those words would be word in this vocabulary.

15
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,210
So there are 943 of those.

16
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:13,148
And the corresponding labels such as the other from city

17
00:01:13,148 --> 00:01:17,960
to city, add date, would be considered as labels.

18
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,453
There are 26 intent tags in the data set.

19
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:28,965
We will not be using that in this tutorial,

20
00:01:28,965 --> 00:01:33,162
we'll just be using the first two as the input, and

21
00:01:33,162 --> 00:01:37,180
this is the corresponding label for the output.

22
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:41,866
Now, let's take a look at what one of that sentence might

23
00:01:41,866 --> 00:01:42,520
look like.

24
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,020
We always start with this tag called beginning of sentence.

25
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:49,519
And then the real query,

26
00:01:49,519 --> 00:01:54,504
which is the please give me the flights from Boston to

27
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:59,848
Pittsburgh on Thursday of next week, end of sentence.

28
00:01:59,848 --> 00:02:04,678
This token beginning of sentence is the 178th

29
00:02:04,678 --> 00:02:09,268
word in the vocabulary, and that is lit up, so

30
00:02:09,268 --> 00:02:12,700
we indicate it in this format.

31
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,030
This is the format in which the data will be represented for

32
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:19,590
the tutorials and the exercises that you're gonna do.

33
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,680
And this belongs to the 19th sequence,

34
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,080
that means this sentence that you have

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,799
is the 19th sentence from the ATIS data set that have used.

36
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,480
And corresponding to that word, there's a label.

37
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,350
You can see most of them are labeled as others.

38
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:38,440
Which means, I don't really care about it,

39
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,780
it is some other token.

40
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:45,979
And in each case, we have the corresponding index,

41
00:02:45,979 --> 00:02:51,390
similar to the Word Index where that token is present.

42
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:59,410
So here, Boston becomes B-fromloc.city_name and

43
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,620
Pittsburg becomes B-to loc.city_name.

44
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:11,058
Thursday is depart_date.day_name and next week

45
00:03:11,058 --> 00:03:17,630
is depart_date.date_relative time frame the label.

46
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,970
So you can have any labels that you would want to associate with

47
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,190
this tags.

48
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,710
So it's not necessary that you'll only have these.

49
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:29,526
So for instance if you wanted to say that I want to tag all

50
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:31,203
prepositions, so

51
00:03:31,203 --> 00:03:35,833
you could have on as like preposition token for say.

52
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:39,628
But in this case we are interested in tagging text or

53
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:44,131
words in a sentence that have connotation with air traffic,

54
00:03:44,131 --> 00:03:46,781
travel information services, and

55
00:03:46,781 --> 00:03:50,863
these are the tokens that are provided in the data set.

56
00:03:50,863 --> 00:03:55,307
So again, the sequence 19 indicates the sentence is

57
00:03:55,307 --> 00:03:58,311
the 19th sentence in the data set.

58
00:03:58,311 --> 00:04:03,300
Word Index, whatever number, ###:1 indicates the position

59
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:06,713
of the corresponding word in the vocabulary,

60
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:09,174
there are total of 943 words.

61
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:13,642
And corresponding to those words, this number which is

62
00:04:13,642 --> 00:04:18,585
###:1, again indicates one of these numbers here which

63
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:22,767
would be the location or the index of that particular

64
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:27,356
labelled in the label set of vocabulary if you might say.

65
00:04:27,356 --> 00:04:32,264
And the corresponding tag in the tag index which would be a total

66
00:04:32,264 --> 00:04:33,936
of 129 tags here.
