00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,690
Welcome to module 5.

1
00:00:01,690 --> 00:00:04,622
In this module and the next one,

2
00:00:04,622 --> 00:00:09,160
we are gonna cover recurrent networks and LSTMs.

3
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,860
Now recurrent networks require you to understand

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,570
a few new concepts that we will explain.

5
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:19,300
And it is very important to understand this

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,750
concept at a fundamental level

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,300
where you build the intuition of how to use recurrence.

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:28,110
And at the same time you also understand

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:32,660
what data you might have and how that data fits into

10
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:35,750
building the deep models with the current and LSTM cells.

11
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:41,140
Once you build the model, you can fill out with the different

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,250
network architectures and build very,

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:46,300
very interesting use cases.

14
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:49,060
We'll talk about some of those use cases

15
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:51,580
towards the end of module six as well.

16
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,130
Let's look at this module.

17
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:58,640
This module is a fundamental module which will introduce you

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,350
to the concepts of recurrence and

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:04,020
LSTMs, before we can get into the advanced use cases that we

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:08,270
will get into towards the end of the next module.

21
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:12,410
In here, we will start with an application

22
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,550
related to time series forecasting with IOT data.

23
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:20,150
Remember we had that solar panel example in the very beginning of

24
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:22,330
the course, we will build on top of it.

25
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,180
We'll introduce to you what recurrence means.

26
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,010
We'll introduce you to the long short term memory cell.

27
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,665
The key concepts in this module are gonna be recurrence, LSTMs,

28
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:35,020
and Dropout.

29
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,304
And finally, we will walk you through that train, test and

30
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,428
predict workflow.
