00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,795
>> In this course, we'll learn how to program Python

1
00:00:10,795 --> 00:00:16,040
3.0 using Jupyter Notebooks in your web browser.

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,745
Our Jupyter Notebooks will be hosted at

3
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:24,980
azure.com and will need a Windows account to login,

4
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,505
so that we can run,

5
00:00:26,505 --> 00:00:30,010
edit, and save our notebooks.

6
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,580
To log in, you'll need

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,995
a Microsoft account, such as Hotmail,

8
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:38,805
live.com, Outlook or Office 365,

9
00:00:38,805 --> 00:00:42,220
which you may have gotten from your work or school.

10
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,500
If you don't have one of these accounts,

11
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,275
you can just use any email account,

12
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:52,885
which can be completed by following

13
00:00:52,885 --> 00:00:55,940
the link from the login screen.

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:02,325
In this course, we'll host

15
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:07,005
our Jupyter Notebooks at notebooks.azure.com.

16
00:01:07,005 --> 00:01:09,400
Click the "Sign in",

17
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,725
enter the email address

18
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,260
associated with your Microsoft account,

19
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,570
and then enter your password.

20
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:25,945
Find the notebook link on this page or,

21
00:01:25,945 --> 00:01:29,215
for school course, from the instructor.

22
00:01:29,215 --> 00:01:32,725
Paste the link into the browser address bar.

23
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,290
You'll be able to have read-only

24
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,995
access if you're not logged in,

25
00:01:38,995 --> 00:01:40,540
but if you're logged in,

26
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,730
you'll be able to run the notebooks.

27
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,785
To make a copy of the notebook,

28
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:48,275
click "Clone" and then click "Clone"

29
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:53,440
again to save a copy under your own notebook account.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,020
Let's look at the notebook that

31
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,715
we had open for this video.

32
00:01:58,715 --> 00:02:02,320
We saw that we can log in to Windows account,

33
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,860
and that we know how to navigate to a library and clone.

34
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,660
We can get further acquainted with

35
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,790
our Jupyter Notebook by creating a new notebook.

36
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,784
So, let's go to File,

37
00:02:16,784 --> 00:02:20,100
New Notebook, and let's choose Python 3.0.

38
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:23,875
Note, there are other languages including Python 2.0.

39
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:27,530
We use Python 3.0 in this course.

40
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:32,205
When I create a new notebook,

41
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:34,570
I can give it a title.

42
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,020
The first cell created in

43
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:48,289
a Jupyter Notebook is a code cell by default.

44
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,550
We can change that into something

45
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:54,530
called a markdown cell as well.

46
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,530
Markdown cells are where the instructions

47
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:03,955
and explanations are written for these Jupyter Notebooks.

48
00:03:03,955 --> 00:03:08,035
We can enter some text in markdown cell,

49
00:03:08,035 --> 00:03:11,440
and if we run the cell it'll just display.

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,170
It transforms the text so that we can read it.

51
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:20,290
We also can edit the text with markdown code,

52
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:22,765
which is a formatting that formats it into

53
00:03:22,765 --> 00:03:26,210
HTML code like a web page,

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:31,750
and we can use headings and make list and run that.

55
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,255
Then, that's what we'll see.

56
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:38,470
You will not be expected to edit markdown in this course.

57
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:41,635
You might run into a cell that looks like this state,

58
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:43,930
that you just need to run that cell to

59
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,585
see it out of the markdown code.

60
00:03:46,585 --> 00:03:51,815
After the markdown, we have a new cell here.

61
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,040
Wherever there's a new cell,

62
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,200
it defaults to a code cell,

63
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,735
and there we can write some simple code,

64
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:03,565
like a variable x = 3 just like in your math class,

65
00:04:03,565 --> 00:04:05,450
and you can run those cells.

66
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:09,820
Then, that variable has a value 3 associated with it,

67
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,240
so that when we run the cell to ask this value,

68
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,220
we can output a 3.

69
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,740
That's just a simple preview of how we'll

70
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,230
use code cells in this course.

71
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:22,420
So, now we know how to log in to

72
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:25,750
notebooks.azure.com with our Windows login account,

73
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,580
and that we can navigate to

74
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,710
our libraries or have

75
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:34,565
a link provided to us and we can clone libraries.

76
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:37,670
Also, we can create notebooks in Python

77
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,400
3.0 and we saw two types of cells,

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,880
the code cell and the markdown cell.
