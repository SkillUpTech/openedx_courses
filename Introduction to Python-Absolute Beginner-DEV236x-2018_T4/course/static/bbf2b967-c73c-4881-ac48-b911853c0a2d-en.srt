Hello World is a simple first program that we use when we're

1
00:00:08,194 --> 00:00:11,340
learning a new programming language.

2
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:14,380
It helps ensure that our system is working.

3
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:21,320
We'll run Hello World in Python 3 in our Jupiter notebook.

4
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,110
And we'll use Python 3 throughout the course.

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,580
Enter into the cell which we see is a code cell.

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,220
The word print is typed in lower case.

7
00:00:32,221 --> 00:00:36,920
The print function which can display a message that is surrounded by

8
00:00:36,921 --> 00:00:43,670
quotations and inside parentheses to the standard output.

9
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:46,000
Let's type hello world.

10
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:53,620
Use print in lower case in parentheses containing a message

11
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:55,960
surrounded by quotation marks.

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:01,233
To run the code, choose Cell, Run Cells and

13
00:01:01,234 --> 00:01:03,828
get the message Hello World.

14
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:07,090
We can edit to say Hello Students.

15
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,370
Run the cell this time using a keyboard shortcut,

16
00:01:13,371 --> 00:01:15,750
Ctrl + Enter at the same time.

17
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,010
Now you have coded and run the famous Hello World.
