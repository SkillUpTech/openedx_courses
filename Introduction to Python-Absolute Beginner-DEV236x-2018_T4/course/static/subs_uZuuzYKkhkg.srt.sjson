    "would be less than c and we would not be able to do this check.", 
    "So we're gonna check against those and",

    "If the statement resolves to false,",

    "So let's go ahead and run that code.", 
    "And they ask us to enter the last name,", 
    "we'll put in Babic and it says Welcome the the a, b, c line.", 
    "We could run that again.", 
    "And we could put in Derosa.", 
    "We've seen using string comparisons with our if statements,", 
    "we can control the flow of our programs."
