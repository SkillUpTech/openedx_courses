Welcome to Module Six.

1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:06,340
This is the last module of this series.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,967
We are gonna walk you through a text classification task

3
00:00:11,967 --> 00:00:16,600
using recurrence and LSDMs being the recurrent units.

4
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:21,862
In this module, we are gonna talk about Text classification

5
00:00:21,862 --> 00:00:23,140
with the ATIS data.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,370
We'll talk a little bit more about the ATIS data

7
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,140
specifically, we're doing the module.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:33,050
You already are familiar with recurrence last term cells, so

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,350
we will build a model using that.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,290
We'll talk about different recurrent

11
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:40,340
networks towards the end.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:44,840
And we'll introduce you to a concept of embedding,

13
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:48,730
which will help us process the text data that you will start

14
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:50,060
seeing in this module.

15
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:56,240
And then finally, as always, Train-Test, and Predict Workflow

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,100
will help us put together the application end to end.
