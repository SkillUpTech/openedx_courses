We've talked about the data types for string and integer,

1
00:00:08,303 --> 00:00:10,905
now let's add in float and the type function so

2
00:00:10,906 --> 00:00:15,600
that we can programmably understand what type we're working with.

3
00:00:15,601 --> 00:00:21,355
So, the decimal in this literal number here,

4
00:00:21,356 --> 00:00:25,950
3.14, makes this a float data type.

5
00:00:25,951 --> 00:00:31,670
It's a floating decimal point and so any number with a decimal,

6
00:00:31,671 --> 00:00:36,770
it could have just all decimal is a float

7
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:44,400
versus the counting numbers are gonna be the integer types.

8
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:49,470
Now, what I did here is I put those into the type function and

9
00:00:49,471 --> 00:00:52,770
it returns the type of the variable.

10
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:56,317
Right here, it is just echoing it to the screen and

11
00:00:56,318 --> 00:00:59,024
we could also just print that as well.

12
00:01:05,132 --> 00:01:09,788
When we print it, we get a little bit more information and

13
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:14,541
it says it's a class int right there and if I add a decimal,

14
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,490
then I get class float.

15
00:01:18,770 --> 00:01:22,890
The type also will work for strings as we show below here.

16
00:01:24,310 --> 00:01:28,067
And it can also display in a variable, so

17
00:01:28,068 --> 00:01:32,276
if we assign student- "Colette" in here.

18
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:39,135
We should throw it's a string, but we can change that to the number

19
00:01:39,136 --> 00:01:43,763
again, student number, in quotes, it's gonna be a string.

20
00:01:43,764 --> 00:01:49,625
Without quotes, It's a integer.

21
00:01:52,915 --> 00:01:56,190
Even if it's the name it's gonna be a string again.

22
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:59,180
So we learned about a new type,

23
00:01:59,181 --> 00:02:01,320
the float, which is floating decimal point.

24
00:02:01,321 --> 00:02:06,800
And that's any number with a decimal within it, a fractional number.

25
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:10,850
We also learned that the type function can help us return the type

26
00:02:10,851 --> 00:02:13,560
of a different variable or a literal type.
