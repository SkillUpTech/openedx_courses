&gt;&gt; Our courses are free as all learning should be.

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,500
&gt;&gt; For a shareable, verified certificate, there is the fee.

24
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,230
&gt;&gt; While our courses offer different experiences,

25
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:19,470
all of them shared a similar approach.
