00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:05,346
A variable is just a container.

1
00:00:05,347 --> 00:00:08,661
It's a name storage location that holds an object.

2
00:00:08,662 --> 00:00:11,745
You might have used variables in math and

3
00:00:11,746 --> 00:00:16,832
you think of x equals five or other equations that have variables.

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:19,080
It's similar in Python.

5
00:00:19,081 --> 00:00:23,759
With Python, we use variables so that we can re-use code and

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,535
we can assign different values to the variable.

7
00:00:29,687 --> 00:00:35,430
So in Python, we use very simple names.

8
00:00:35,431 --> 00:00:36,600
As we show here, for

9
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:39,540
a student_name that would be a good example of a variable.

10
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,280
It's descriptive, we use lower case and

11
00:00:42,281 --> 00:00:44,060
we connect it with an underscore.

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,360
Variables can also be assigned strings

13
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:50,910
not just numbers like in math.

14
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:58,430
And if we run that cell, we don't get an echo but

15
00:00:58,431 --> 00:01:03,990
what we've done is we've assigned this storage location,

16
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:05,930
which has a student name

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,930
with a string of the student's name, that's in quotes.

18
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:16,825
Then we can call back on that variable and

19
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,814
we see that it will echo below.

20
00:01:22,187 --> 00:01:27,487
We can also print the literal string as we did in earlier assignments.

21
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:34,404
But through using a variable I can automate that.

22
00:01:34,405 --> 00:01:38,027
And I can have a different student name going through this print

23
00:01:38,028 --> 00:01:39,325
statement each time,

24
00:01:39,326 --> 00:01:42,485
where other code can change the value of student name.

25
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:46,816
So, what would that look like?

26
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:49,785
Well we call that variable reassignment.

27
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:54,487
And we see the example below, the first time that print ran,

28
00:01:54,488 --> 00:01:57,400
it had the student name of Joana.

29
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:03,594
Then, we reassigned the variable with Colette, and

30
00:02:03,595 --> 00:02:06,658
when we print it again, Colette prints.

31
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,441
>> If we go back up to the top, we can rerun the cell and

32
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:15,979
reinitialize the variable.

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,870
And then we can check the further value now in student_name.

34
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:28,342
Now it is Joana and we can see that if I re-run this previous cell and

35
00:02:28,343 --> 00:02:33,541
then rerun the student_name again, it will change back to Colette.

36
00:02:36,233 --> 00:02:40,865
>> So, a variable is a name storage address that we can use in our code,

37
00:02:40,866 --> 00:02:44,196
just the same we do as a literal string or number or

38
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:47,450
other objects we'll see later.

39
00:02:47,451 --> 00:02:51,810
A variable means change as well, so remember we can

40
00:02:51,811 --> 00:02:55,560
reuse that variable within our code and make it more efficient.
