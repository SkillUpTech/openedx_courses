00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:06,355
Let's walk through the final required coding activity.

1
00:00:06,355 --> 00:00:08,660
As with the other activities,

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,420
there are required keywords that if these are

3
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,405
not included in your submitted code,

4
00:00:14,405 --> 00:00:17,765
your answer will be marked incorrect.

5
00:00:17,765 --> 00:00:23,720
So we are going to build our adding report.

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,730
We're going to build functions so we

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:27,860
have the def keyword.

8
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,830
We're going to loop until we

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,025
get a proper type of input using while statement.

10
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:38,810
We'll do some comparisons with if, elif,

11
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:43,795
and then we'll also use the else keyword.

12
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:48,620
We will be casting some inputs to int to be

13
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:55,020
integers and we will be testing if input is an integer.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,670
Also we'll be printing output to

15
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:03,748
the user and of course we'll need to get user input.

16
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:09,040
Let's take a look at the edX page for

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,580
this activity and we have

18
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,070
our familiar assignment requirements

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:16,685
that we just went over.

20
00:01:16,685 --> 00:01:18,520
Please review those.

21
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:21,715
And there are additional requirements in

22
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:25,605
telling you how the program works.

23
00:01:25,605 --> 00:01:28,630
Let's take a quick look at

24
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,325
this diagram where it shows we start in this area

25
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:41,755
here and jump into a while true loop,

26
00:01:41,755 --> 00:01:45,900
so that's what this here means and that you continue

27
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,090
off to the input

28
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:55,600
and find out if it's a quit or if it's a digit.

29
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,516
If it's a digit,

30
00:01:57,516 --> 00:01:59,340
we're going to add it to

31
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,050
a total and if it's

32
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:03,055
not we're going to see if they said quit,

33
00:02:03,055 --> 00:02:07,020
otherwise we're going to say this

34
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,970
is invalid input and it takes us

35
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,950
all the way back to the true,

36
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:14,070
so we keep this is that loop right there where we

37
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,310
keep input going until we

38
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,860
get a valid input which is either something

39
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:24,805
that starts with q or a digit.

40
00:02:24,805 --> 00:02:30,265
So in our Jupiter notebook I've preloaded this with

41
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:33,100
function code and so

42
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:36,595
we can run it and see what it looks like.

43
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:38,485
And it asks us to choose

44
00:02:38,485 --> 00:02:41,410
a report type A or T and we could put

45
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,245
in an invalid response

46
00:02:44,245 --> 00:02:47,233
and then we see that it continues to ask us,

47
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:51,400
so I'll put A for all items and

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,734
then it asks us to either enter a integer or to quit.

49
00:02:56,734 --> 00:03:04,300
So I'll enter an integer and another and then I'll quit.

50
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,720
And then we can see our report which

51
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,510
shows there's two items added with a total of six.

52
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:18,810
We can run the report again with just the total mode.

53
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:23,045
And again we can enter a number of integers.

54
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:27,515
We can do this time some invalid input

55
00:03:27,515 --> 00:03:31,000
or invalid because it's

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,920
not all digits, it's not integers.

57
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,340
And so we can only put in

58
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:41,975
integer values and then we can quit and get our total.

59
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:44,980
So when we enter T it just gives

60
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,100
us our total when we enter A it's

61
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,980
going to show all of the values that we

62
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,460
entered and it will give us a total as well.

63
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:59,730
So be sure we use all of these keywords.

64
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,760
Good luck on your final project.
