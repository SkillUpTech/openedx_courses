    "Let's walk through the final required coding activity.", 
    "As with the other activities,", 
    "there are required keywords that if these are", 
    "not included in your submitted code,", 
    "your answer will be marked incorrect.", 
    "So we are going to build our adding report.", 
    "We're going to build functions so we", 
    "have the def keyword.", 
    "We're going to loop until we", 
    "get a proper type of input using while statement.", 
    "We'll do some comparisons with if, elif,", 
    "and then we'll also use the else keyword.", 
    "We will be casting some inputs to int to be", 
    "integers and we will be testing if input is an integer.", 
    "Also we'll be printing output to", 
    "the user and of course we'll need to get user input.", 
    "Let's take a look at the edX page for", 
    "this activity and we have", 
    "our familiar assignment requirements", 
    "that we just went over.", 
    "Please review those.", 
    "And there are additional requirements in", 
    "telling you how the program works.", 
    "Let's take a quick look at", 
    "this diagram where it shows we start in this area", 
    "here and jump into a while true loop,", 
    "so that's what this here means and that you continue", 
    "off to the input", 
    "and find out if it's a quit or if it's a digit.", 
    "If it's a digit,", 
    "we're going to add it to", 
    "a total and if it's", 
    "not we're going to see if they said quit,", 
    "otherwise we're going to say this", 
    "is invalid input and it takes us", 
    "all the way back to the true,", 
    "so we keep this is that loop right there where we", 
    "keep input going until we", 
    "get a valid input which is either something", 
    "that starts with q or a digit.", 
    "So in our Jupiter notebook I've preloaded this with", 
    "function code and so", 
    "we can run it and see what it looks like.", 
    "And it asks us to choose", 
    "a report type A or T and we could put", 
    "in an invalid response", 
    "and then we see that it continues to ask us,", 
    "so I'll put A for all items and", 
    "then it asks us to either enter a integer or to quit.", 
    "So I'll enter an integer and another and then I'll quit.", 
    "And then we can see our report which", 
    "shows there's two items added with a total of six.", 
    "We can run the report again with just the total mode.", 
    "And again we can enter a number of integers.", 
    "We can do this time some invalid input", 
    "or invalid because it's", 
    "not all digits, it's not integers.", 
    "And so we can only put in", 
    "integer values and then we can quit and get our total.", 
    "So when we enter T it just gives", 
    "us our total when we enter A it's", 
    "going to show all of the values that we", 
    "entered and it will give us a total as well.", 
    "So be sure we use all of these keywords.", 
    "Good luck on your final project."
