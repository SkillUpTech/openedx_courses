00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,550
Congratulations, you have made through module one and two, and

1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:05,850
now into module three.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,940
This is gonna be our first deep learned model.

3
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,190
One of the simplest ones, but yet very, very powerful.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,500
And it's used in a large number of contexts.

5
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:23,290
So even though it's very, very simple it's very foundational,

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:26,710
you'll use it for many of your applications and

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,264
find it very useful.

8
00:00:28,264 --> 00:00:31,544
More importantly, the concepts that you will learn here

9
00:00:31,544 --> 00:00:34,494
are going to be applicable in subsequent modules.

10
00:00:34,494 --> 00:00:37,861
So pay attention to the different concepts that

11
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:41,420
are gonna get introduced in this session.

12
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:46,140
Additionally, I would like you to start building the notion of

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,850
the layers of neurons in the brain.

14
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:53,110
Keep that in mind in order to have higher level of cognition

15
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:57,230
that, us, human being do, we need to bring that into

16
00:00:57,230 --> 00:01:01,630
the machines and deep learned models enable us to do that.

17
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:04,710
With that, let me walk you through what to expect

18
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,390
in this module.

19
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,950
In this module, we'll have the same application which is

20
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:15,720
the optical character recognition using MNIST data.

21
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,330
We want to use the same dataset so that you get

22
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,600
really comfortable in using MNIST data with the task of

23
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:26,970
recognizing the digits and focus on building different modules,

24
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,890
which comprises of different deep learning models.

25
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,728
In this module, we'll do a recap of logistic regression,

26
00:01:36,728 --> 00:01:41,770
and then we'll go into multi-layer perception.

27
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:44,871
The concepts that you'll learn here are gonna be activation

28
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:46,240
functions.

29
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,570
These are key to make the deep learning models work well.

30
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:56,784
And then, finally, we'll walk you through the train, test and

31
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,243
predict workflow using multi-layer perceptrons.
