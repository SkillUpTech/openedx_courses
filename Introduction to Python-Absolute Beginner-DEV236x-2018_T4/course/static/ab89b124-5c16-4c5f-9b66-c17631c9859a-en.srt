Comparison operators such as greater than, less than or

1
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:14,080
equal to, can be used to evaluate to a true/false boolean.

2
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:18,480
Let's take a look at each of the comparison operators Starting

3
00:00:18,481 --> 00:00:22,000
with >, 3 > 5 is False.

4
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:26,425
3 < 5 is True.

5
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:33,700
3 > 3 is False.

6
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,000
So we can use a > or =.

7
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,057
3 > or = 3 is True.

8
00:00:39,058 --> 00:00:44,470
These work just like we've seen in our math class.

9
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:48,020
Assignment versus comparing.

10
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,150
Here we're going to assign points the value of 0.

11
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:56,940
The single equals sign is used for assignment.

12
00:00:56,941 --> 00:00:59,183
To compare, we use two equals signs.

13
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:02,703
These points = to 9.

14
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:05,130
That is false.

15
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:09,850
If we set the value to 9, we can see the comparison is now true.

16
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,510
Not equal can be confusing when used in comparison.

17
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,350
Here we're gonna assign x the value of 3.

18
00:01:21,351 --> 00:01:25,940
So the not equals sign is used here in this comparison

19
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:29,628
in the print statement and it returns a boolean true or false.

20
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:33,780
Is x != 9?

21
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:37,960
Is x Equal to 3?

22
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:44,390
Here we see x not equal to 9 is true because x is 3.

23
00:01:44,391 --> 00:01:47,460
And x equal to 3 is true.

24
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:51,500
So now we can run different comparison operators

25
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:53,520
that return our boolean values.
