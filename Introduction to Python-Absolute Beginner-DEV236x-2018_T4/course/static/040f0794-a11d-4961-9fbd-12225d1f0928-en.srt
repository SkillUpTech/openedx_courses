Nested conditionals allows subdecisions to be made by indenting

1
00:00:08,966 --> 00:00:13,498
conditional statements underneath other conditional statements.

2
00:00:13,499 --> 00:00:18,279
Let's take a look at nested conditionals indenting.

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,646
If we run this first if statement and it evaluates to true,

4
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:27,777
the code indented will run.

5
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:32,800
In this case, we see further if statements.

6
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:37,190
If the second indented if statement evaluates to true,

7
00:00:37,191 --> 00:00:38,959
then the code underneath that will run.

8
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,470
This means we can run a series of questions.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,860
Let's look at the example below.

10
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:54,431
We have a number that we assume will either be 1,

11
00:00:54,432 --> 00:00:57,980
2 or 3 for the code below.

12
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:03,830
The first if statement checks is the number greater than or equal to 2.

13
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:07,487
Starting number with 1, it is not greater or equal to 2.

14
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:12,121
And so the if statement moves to the matching else statement and

15
00:01:12,122 --> 00:01:13,990
prints the number as 1.

16
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:14,490
Let's run the code.

17
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:22,497
If we set the number to 2, we expect to enter the code under

18
00:01:22,498 --> 00:01:27,615
the first if statement because 2 is greater than or equal to 2.

19
00:01:27,616 --> 00:01:35,230
The second if statement says is the number greater than 2?

20
00:01:35,231 --> 00:01:35,730
No.

21
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:40,420
So the else statement runs and it prints the "number is 2".

22
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:51,005
With 3, we get the number 3 by being greater

23
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:55,550
than 2 and then greater than 2 again.

24
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,480
We can also review this flow chart that is included in the notebook.

25
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:10,210
Here we start with the question whether we want a cheese or

26
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:11,770
veggie sandwich.

27
00:02:11,771 --> 00:02:14,310
If you want a cheese sandwich,

28
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:16,930
then you can continue to ask another question.

29
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:22,060
So this, if it's true, we can go to this nested if statement and

30
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:24,660
then ask the type of cheese.

31
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:25,750
Let's look at the code.

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,326
Here we ask for input whether we want cheese or veggie.

33
00:02:32,327 --> 00:02:34,511
And we check, if it's s for

34
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:39,553
cheese then we can run the code below and ask the type of cheese.

35
00:02:47,493 --> 00:02:51,149
If I ask for cheese, then I could say I want manchego cheese.

36
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:55,160
And then it gives me my manchego cheese sandwich.

37
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,360
I can run the code again.

38
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,699
I can ask for a veggie sandwich.

39
00:03:05,377 --> 00:03:08,215
And it gives me my vegetable special.

40
00:03:12,497 --> 00:03:17,570
Nested if conditionals allow us to make subdecisions in our code.
