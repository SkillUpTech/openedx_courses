0
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:06,060
Boolean string methods were interesting

1
00:00:06,130 --> 00:00:07,890
because they could test and tell us

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,110
if something was upper, lower or maybe

3
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,700
even capitalized. So, we're now we have the

4
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,090
String format Methods

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,470
and they're going to actually help us change a String into uppercase

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:23,670
or lowercase or title case et cetera.

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,020
So let's take a look at the String format Method.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:31,510
So, the format Methods allow us to actually alter the string.

9
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:33,710
So we have a hard coded string right here,

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:37,230
literal string and we're going to use

11
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,000
the lower command and that should change the uppercase letters to lower.

12
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:44,690
So let's run that, so we see up.

13
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,510
Everything is lowercase now, let's try to edit.

14
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,490
In the upper method, puts it to all caps.

15
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,200
And we can also use the capitalize. And capitalize--

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:09,910
capitalize will capitalize a word or a sentence with the first

17
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,880
word or the first letter of a sentence.

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:14,560
And so you can see here that the

19
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,290
title Miss is now capitalized but there may be

20
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,360
a unintended consequences when you're

21
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:29,710
using this in a sentence that every word is not capitalized, just the first word

22
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:32,340
and it doesn't-- it doesn't keep the

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:37,330
old cases, it puts everything else following it to lowercase.

24
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:41,470
And so that can be useful especially for single words but title is

25
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:46,110
maybe more interesting and we have the title below for this print

26
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,980
time to save your code and title

27
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:52,690
looks like a book title and every word gets capitalized. So,

28
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,180
time to save your code

29
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,870
and then there is swap case which can be useful at times, but it's more--

30
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,240
I think find then a use case

31
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,490
and so, you can see I get the opposite, all lower case

32
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:15,400
becomes all uppercase and capitalized words become

33
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:20,440
uppercase with the first word lowercase.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,240
So, using String format Methods we can alter strings to be

35
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,310
all uppercase, all lowercase, title case et cetera.

36
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,910
And they be very useful in our programs.
