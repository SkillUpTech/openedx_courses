    "from the solar panel and the", 
    "corresponding output which is the power", 
    "generated for that particular day",

    "this case you can see that these are", 
    "different time instances for any", 
    "given day and these numbers are the", 
    "same because the total amount of current", 
    "generated for that particular day is the", 
    "same, but if you go and change these",

    "length of 8 to 14.", 
    "Here is our LSTM network setup, note that", 
    "we do not specify the maximum length as", 
    "a part of our model and we do not need", 
    "to pad our variable length sequences so", 
    "the sequences can be of length from 8 to",

    "the recurrence units", 
    "and we just sample the output from the", 
    "last LSTM cell and then we add a little", 
    "bit of a drop out to prevent overfitting",

    "value which corresponds to the", 
    "predicted output of the solar panel",

    "here, the network code is a direct",

    "of the cells being LSTM's and their", 
    "internal state being hidden dimensions of 14.", 
    "We sample the data or we pick up", 
    "the data rather from the last cell, pass it to a dropout", 
    "and then project our predicted", 
    "value of the solar panel output here.", 
    "Once we have the model then we are going", 
    "to train this is again much too familiar", 
    "to you except for the fact in this case", 
    "instead of just C.input_variable you have a C.sequence.input_variable, this is", 
    "important because we are dealing with", 
    "sequence data, we get our model here", 
    "and the corresponding labels are also a set", 
    "of layer set of scalars for this", 
    "particular set of input values yep!", 
    "We set a learning rate, a fixed learning", 
    "rate in this case and each create a schedule learning rate", 
    "schedule in many applications you may", 
    "want to explore with different learning", 
    "rates and different learning rate", 
    "schedules. You can try these things out",

    "what we have been using for them this", 
    "data because that task was from", 
    "classification in this case it's a", 
    "regression, so we use a squared error", 
    "where we minimize the difference between", 
    "the predicted solar panel output and the", 
    "observed output of the solar panel", 
    "and the same is used for the error", 
    "function then we can instantiate our",

    "is instantiated then you can run through", 
    "the entire data set and you can", 
    "train the parameters of the model by", 
    "calling trainer.train_minibatch", 
    "by feeding the corresponding minibatch", 
    "features and the corresponding labels.", 
    "This notebook is going to take a while", 
    "to run and once it's done in this case", 
    "you can see that the loss in general", 
    "reduces quite a bit, here is the plot of", 
    "how the training progresses over the", 
    "number of different iterations. And you", 
    "can then start plotting the mean square", 
    "error for the training validation and test data", 
    "here and finally you can visualize the predictions.", 
    "Here you can see that the", 
    "blue is the raw observations and the", 
    "orange one is the predictions and in general they are pretty close.", 
    "Even with 200 iterations is what we had", 
    "started-off let me quickly check, if it", 
    "was you have trained this one for 200 iterations.", 
    "Let me quickly check that, yes it is", 
    "indeed 200 passes that we have used but", 
    "if you were to use a much larger amount", 
    "of training which is set to 2,000 then", 
    "you will see this curves becoming even", 
    "closer to the observed values.", 
    "With that you are ready", 
    "to do the assignments associated with this lab."
