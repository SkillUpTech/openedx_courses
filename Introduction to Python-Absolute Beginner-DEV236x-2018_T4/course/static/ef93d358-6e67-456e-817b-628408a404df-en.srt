00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:12,130
Function parameters allow data to be passed to and used by functions.

1
00:00:12,131 --> 00:00:16,924
This example uses a parameter in the function definition.

2
00:00:16,925 --> 00:00:21,330
Say_this has phrase inside the parentheses and

3
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:23,780
that is the name of a variable.

4
00:00:23,781 --> 00:00:27,820
That variable gets used inside the function code, in this case,

5
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:31,860
in a print statement that is indented inside of the function.

6
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:35,901
So to call that function, we just call it with the argument,

7
00:00:35,902 --> 00:00:38,297
which in this case is a string, HI.

8
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:45,363
And there we go with the string getting passed into the variable

9
00:00:45,364 --> 00:00:49,740
in the parameter list and then that gets used to print.

10
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:50,983
And we can change that.

11
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:58,343
And we see that it will continue to update with whatever value

12
00:00:58,344 --> 00:01:01,120
gets passed as an argument.

13
00:01:01,121 --> 00:01:04,830
So the parameter can be used within the function.

14
00:01:04,831 --> 00:01:07,670
I have a very similar function called yell_this.

15
00:01:07,671 --> 00:01:10,460
And it does exactly what say_this says, except that

16
00:01:10,461 --> 00:01:15,380
it uses a string method to make the phrase into upper case and

17
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:20,800
it uses string addition to put a exclamation point at the end.

18
00:01:20,801 --> 00:01:24,350
So let's call with good morning and

19
00:01:24,351 --> 00:01:29,090
we see that this works as the example above.

20
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:33,280
But what if we wanted a default value, so

21
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:37,570
that we can call this without any arguments?

22
00:01:37,571 --> 00:01:42,740
So I want to call yell_this just with parenthesis and

23
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,060
no argument inside.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,310
How I would do that is when I define my parameter,

25
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:51,182
I would assign it a value.

26
00:01:55,772 --> 00:02:01,140
So I just assigned it a default value of good night and

27
00:02:01,141 --> 00:02:06,874
I can still call it with an argument like good morning and

28
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:10,534
I expect it to act as it did before and

29
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:15,300
it'll just ignore my default value.

30
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,850
But if I call it with no value, it will use the default value.

31
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:21,511
So let's run that code.

32
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:25,695
And we see that in the first instance of the call good morning,

33
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:29,396
the argument was passed and the second with no values,

34
00:02:29,397 --> 00:02:30,860
it uses the default.

35
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:38,310
So now, we know how to define functions with arguments and

36
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:41,430
we know how to give those arguments default values.
