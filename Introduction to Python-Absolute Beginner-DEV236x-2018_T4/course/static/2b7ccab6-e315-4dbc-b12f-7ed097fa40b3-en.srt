Many of you who are not familiar with text processing,

1
00:00:04,313 --> 00:00:08,105
may be wondering how we can convert the text tokens, be

2
00:00:08,105 --> 00:00:12,650
it in the input or in the output labels, into a numerical format.

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:20,185
In a previous module you have seen that when we had the MNIST

4
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:24,175
data, we had taken the digit 3 and represented it

5
00:00:24,175 --> 00:00:28,830
in a one-hot encoding which means that the fourth element

6
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:33,486
with the index starting from 0 would represent digit 3.

7
00:00:33,486 --> 00:00:39,340
We had ten digits, 0 to 9, so the length of the encoding or

8
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:43,130
the one-hot encoded vector was ten.

9
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,800
Similarly, in case of each word,

10
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,650
the One-hot representation is a vector with 943 elements.

11
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:57,330
So for the token boston, which is the 266th element in

12
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,930
the vocabulary of the words that make up the ATIS data set, we

13
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:08,860
will make that 266th element to be 1, rest of it all will be 0.

14
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,450
And the length of this vector would have 943 elements.

15
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:16,580
Similarly, for

16
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,910
each label we would have a one-hot representation.

17
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:23,897
And it would be a vector with 129 elements.
