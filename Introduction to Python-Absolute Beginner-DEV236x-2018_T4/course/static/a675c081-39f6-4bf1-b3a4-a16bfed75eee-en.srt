00:00:02,948 --> 00:00:07,600
We've learned about variables and data types for string and integer.

1
00:00:07,601 --> 00:00:09,560
Let's see a little bit about the behavior,

2
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:10,770
the way they work together.

3
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,190
Let's start with a string data type again.

4
00:00:15,191 --> 00:00:20,500
So we're gonna assign student variable to the string name.

5
00:00:20,501 --> 00:00:23,970
We can echo that on the screen to see what is in student and

6
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,180
that will show below.

7
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:30,530
And that's a string, it's got quotes on it.

8
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,356
It's got letters that are strings, so

9
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:37,045
we are gonna go over here again and change student.

10
00:00:37,046 --> 00:00:42,720
So, maybe student might be some type of id number.

11
00:00:42,721 --> 00:00:45,310
And so I'm gonna change this to 123456, and

12
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:51,010
then let's see how that echoes to the screen.

13
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:54,961
And so now I've changed student, not just reassigned the data, but

14
00:00:54,962 --> 00:00:56,540
reassigned the data type.

15
00:00:56,541 --> 00:01:03,496
We started with a string and now we have an integer.

16
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:07,129
So, this is not something you can do in every language, but

17
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,265
Python allows your variables to change data type.

18
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:13,343
And that's important to know, it can be very useful and

19
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:16,881
it can be something that you'll need to pay attention to because

20
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:19,170
it can cause problems.

21
00:01:19,171 --> 00:01:22,877
If you intended this to be a string and you somehow left it as

22
00:01:22,878 --> 00:01:27,560
the number, it might still continue to run as an integer.

23
00:01:27,561 --> 00:01:31,370
So let's change it back to a string and this is a string,

24
00:01:31,371 --> 00:01:36,290
again, a different type of ID that has the last name and

25
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:40,260
some numbers in there as well.

26
00:01:40,261 --> 00:01:44,500
But it's all string because it's in the quotes.

27
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:47,798
So we run that and so that's legal to run that way too and

28
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,467
of course I can print that.

29
00:01:49,468 --> 00:01:53,089
Because it's a variable I can call it, I could go back up and

30
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,340
reassign it again.

31
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:59,486
And so if I run this cell, now student should be 123456 and

32
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:01,880
it's back to a number again.

33
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,640
So we have learned about the two data types, string and integer.

34
00:02:07,641 --> 00:02:12,620
And that in Python, you can assign a variable to string an integer and

35
00:02:12,621 --> 00:02:14,320
change between the data types.
