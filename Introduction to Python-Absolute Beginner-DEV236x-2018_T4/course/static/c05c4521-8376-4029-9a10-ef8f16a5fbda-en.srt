Conditionals help us run the flow of our code using

1
00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:13,980
conditional statements that resolve to true or false.

2
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,520
We will look at if, else, and pass statements.

3
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,210
>> The example has an if True statement.

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,150
True is a Boolean keyword.

5
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:31,560
So if True will do whatever code is indented below the if statement.

6
00:00:33,717 --> 00:00:37,207
If it's not true, and in this case it's always true, so

7
00:00:37,208 --> 00:00:40,850
unless I write false, then we will do the else statement.

8
00:00:40,851 --> 00:00:44,870
So let's just quickly look at how this works out when I run it.

9
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:48,400
So if True, it never gets past if True.

10
00:00:48,401 --> 00:00:52,947
It prints this if statement after if is True.

11
00:00:52,948 --> 00:00:55,794
And the statement after if is True.

12
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:58,276
To get to the else statement,

13
00:00:58,277 --> 00:01:02,557
we would have to have whatever's here be not True.

14
00:01:02,558 --> 00:01:06,782
And so we can actually use these keywords, not and True.

15
00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:12,702
And then we see that the else statement will print when

16
00:01:12,703 --> 00:01:14,192
something's Not True.

17
00:01:15,782 --> 00:01:19,729
The more typical way we think of Not True, is we think of it as False.

18
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,819
And this is also the Boolean keyword, False.

19
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,887
So as different statements evaluate to True or False,

20
00:01:30,888 --> 00:01:35,850
we can execute either the if statement or the else.

21
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:40,890
A way to understand that a little more easily is we can set

22
00:01:40,891 --> 00:01:44,420
right here a variable to True or False.

23
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:47,140
And so, I have someone I know is True.

24
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:52,490
And if someone I know is True then I'll say, how have you been?

25
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:57,570
Else, if it's Not True, I'll print nice to meet you.

26
00:01:57,571 --> 00:01:59,630
And so I say how have you been?

27
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:03,050
And then I could have something later where I determine

28
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,830
that I don't know who that person is, and so is it someone I know?

29
00:02:08,831 --> 00:02:09,570
That is False.

30
00:02:09,571 --> 00:02:14,400
So I look here, if someone I know, if it's True or

31
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:18,330
False, and I should see that nice to meet you.

32
00:02:19,490 --> 00:02:21,270
And it says nice to meet you.

33
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:25,880
Sometimes though, when I run a if statement or an else statement,

34
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:28,980
I really want only one of the conditions to execute.

35
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:33,300
What that means is I would only wanna print, how have you been or

36
00:02:33,301 --> 00:02:34,140
nice to meet you.

37
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:37,790
And so if I do not wanna do anything,

38
00:02:37,791 --> 00:02:39,953
I can just write the word pass.

39
00:02:39,954 --> 00:02:43,260
And this is a keyword, it turns green.

40
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:47,210
And so nothing happens in this case.

41
00:02:47,211 --> 00:02:48,590
And then if I write True.

42
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:56,810
Then it will run the how have you been path.

43
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,932
So, if statements evaluate if they are True, and

44
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:06,895
if Not True they will move to the else statement.
