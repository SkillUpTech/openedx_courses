00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:03,637
We're going to review module four:

1
00:00:03,637 --> 00:00:07,165
Required Coding Activity on string analysis.

2
00:00:07,165 --> 00:00:09,385
And in this activity,

3
00:00:09,385 --> 00:00:13,540
you have some key word requirements listed below.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,188
We have to define a function and use the def key word.

5
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:19,594
We'll have a while loop,

6
00:00:19,594 --> 00:00:23,345
that will loop while we're inputting a valid input,

7
00:00:23,345 --> 00:00:25,935
so we can't have an empty string entered.

8
00:00:25,935 --> 00:00:28,480
We're going to use if,

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,000
and then we're going to either use else or elif.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,290
Also, we'll be using the int,

11
00:00:36,290 --> 00:00:42,665
to cast input into a integer or a digit.

12
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:48,710
We're going to check if input is digit or is alpha.

13
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:52,970
And of course, we'll have to get user input and we will

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:57,107
be printing some results to our users.

15
00:00:57,107 --> 00:01:04,905
Let's look at the edx page for this coding activity.

16
00:01:04,905 --> 00:01:07,427
And like the other pages,

17
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:09,360
there are the assignment requirements,

18
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,805
that we just looked at.

19
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:15,030
And we'll have that same information

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,415
on our Jupiter notebook.

21
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:22,410
We should use the Jupiter notebook to code our solution.

22
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:26,340
I've pre-loaded this page with a solution,

23
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,727
so that we can see how it runs.

24
00:01:30,727 --> 00:01:34,315
So it asks us to enter a word or an integer.

25
00:01:34,315 --> 00:01:35,765
If we enter nothing,

26
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:39,583
it will continue to ask us for input.

27
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:42,935
So, let's go ahead and just run that again.

28
00:01:42,935 --> 00:01:46,890
Okay, so now we can enter in a word,

29
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:49,780
so which is right word.

30
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:53,880
And we see that word is all alphabetical characters.

31
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,550
So it checks if the input is all alpha.

32
00:01:59,550 --> 00:02:03,120
For that message, we can run it

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:09,655
again and I can put in a series of digits.

34
00:02:09,655 --> 00:02:12,930
And it says, "that's a pretty big number",

35
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,754
because that's bigger than 99.

36
00:02:14,754 --> 00:02:17,875
So let's go ahead and run it again.

37
00:02:17,875 --> 00:02:21,570
I could run it with something smaller.

38
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:29,000
And it says that is "28 is smaller than expected".

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,990
We can also just see how the behavior works otherwise.

40
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,795
So if I say 22.5,

41
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:41,965
it says "that's not all alpha or all digit characters".

42
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:44,450
And some of us might disagree with that,

43
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,758
but it's looking at the characters,

44
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:50,650
it's not looking at the data type.

45
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:54,145
And this may look like it is a float,

46
00:02:54,145 --> 00:02:55,585
but is actually a string,

47
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:58,785
and it's a string that contains a non-digit.

48
00:02:58,785 --> 00:03:02,555
So likewise, if we are running,

49
00:03:02,555 --> 00:03:07,282
it asks us for a word or integer,

50
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:11,500
so if I put Alton Derosoa,

51
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,270
it's also not an alpha or a digit

52
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,190
because a space is not

53
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:22,380
an alphabetical character or a digit.

54
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,690
So, you can go ahead and build that code.

55
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:29,710
Make sure you keep getting input until it has

56
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,250
something in there that it checks for the empty input.

57
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,920
And then we test whether it is an integer or digit.

58
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,655
If it's a digit, we're going to have to

59
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:42,370
convert that into a number.

60
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,870
See how big it is, and use some nested comparisons.

61
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:53,005
So, make sure we're going to use all of these keywords.

62
00:03:53,005 --> 00:03:56,482
And if you're having trouble submitting,

63
00:03:56,482 --> 00:03:57,490
look at some of

64
00:03:57,490 --> 00:04:02,420
the earlier required coding activity videos.
