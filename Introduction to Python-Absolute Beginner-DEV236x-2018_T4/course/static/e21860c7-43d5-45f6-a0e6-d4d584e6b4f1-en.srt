00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:05,810
Let's do brief recap of basic machine learning

1
00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:08,830
terminologies in this video.

2
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,710
We'll start with understanding what the input data is

3
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:14,610
gonna look like.

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,996
We'll define a very simple model.

5
00:00:19,297 --> 00:00:23,790
And we'll predict whatever our target values are gonna be.

6
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:29,160
These techniques are applicable for both classification and

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:31,400
regression tasks.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,620
But for simplicity, in this video,

9
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,063
we are gonna focus on a regression task.

10
00:00:38,203 --> 00:00:42,125
We have a solar panel where the features x here happens to

11
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:46,216
be a single feature which is the average day temperature in

12
00:00:46,216 --> 00:00:47,480
Fahrenheit.

13
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,660
And we want to predict based on that feature what is the output

14
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,880
of the solar panel in watts for that particular day.

15
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,810
So our input x is the feature in this case is the average day

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:05,280
temperature and the output is the observed output which is

17
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,160
also can be thought of as labels, except that it's

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:11,420
a real number here, which is the solar panel output in watts.

19
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,690
We have a bunch of observations that these are the readings

20
00:01:17,690 --> 00:01:19,800
already collected from the solar panel for

21
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,020
a given day temperature x here.

22
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,477
We have the corresponding value of the y.

23
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,210
We can now fit a very simple model, it's a line.

24
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:35,350
So if you go back to your algebra class,

25
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:40,280
it's defined by a slope, which is the rate of

26
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:45,180
change of y over rate of change of x.

27
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,170
So, this is the slope, and b is the intercept.

28
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:57,950
So our model function has two parameters, slope and intercept.

29
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,910
We learned a model where you have the input coming as

30
00:02:00,910 --> 00:02:04,530
the temperature of the day, the z function is our model,

31
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:08,290
the parameters here are m and b.

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,390
With that we can predict for

33
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,570
any arbitrary temperature the value of y.

34
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,711
So for instance say someday we have a very high temperature

35
00:02:20,711 --> 00:02:23,416
here, daytime temperature is this,

36
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:26,895
the output predicted by our model will be y star.
