00:00:05,331 --> 00:00:10,080
Two common types of errors are the syntax error and the name error.

1
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:13,080
The syntax error is kind of the grammar of Python.

2
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:16,050
If you don't follow the proper rules, you are gonna get an error.

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:19,038
The name error is all about not being able to

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,037
find that name in a program.

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:26,807
The first error we're gonna look at is the syntax error that we saw

6
00:00:26,808 --> 00:00:27,740
before.

7
00:00:27,741 --> 00:00:32,660
And that is the one with strings not having matching quotes.

8
00:00:32,661 --> 00:00:39,160
So if I go ahead and put in a unmatching string quote.

9
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:44,510
So here I have a double quote and then single quote If I run that,

10
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:48,710
I get this no end of line while looking for

11
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:53,070
the string message and what that means is Python is searching and

12
00:00:53,071 --> 00:00:56,180
searching for this double quote and it can't find it.

13
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,225
And so that causes an error so

14
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:02,926
we have to put that back to double quotes and that works properly.

15
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:08,160
Another type of syntax error is with variable names.

16
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:10,290
And variable names can't start with numbers.

17
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:12,890
They can start with an underscore or a letter.

18
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:18,560
And so you can actually see here that the number is showing up

19
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:20,200
in a different color, so

20
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:22,920
Python's giving us a hint that something was wrong there.

21
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:26,410
But if you try to run that it says, it's an invalid syntax.

22
00:01:26,411 --> 00:01:30,450
You just can't use that for a variable name.

23
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:34,410
So you could delete that and that would be able to run.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,286
Or we can put in the student name or- And

25
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:47,610
then that's a valid Python variable assignment.

26
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:52,499
Here you can see again as I highlight in the cell that

27
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,173
the Second parenthesis is facing the wrong way.

28
00:01:57,174 --> 00:02:00,615
And so again I'm gonna get a syntax error and

29
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:05,360
it's not knowing it's saying that this is ended the file but

30
00:02:05,361 --> 00:02:10,478
it doesn't know why it's unexpected and so if we flip that around

31
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,390
then we can see that that type is a float and that runs properly.

32
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:20,260
Another set of errors is the name errors.

33
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:24,560
What that means is Python is going to look for something and

34
00:02:24,561 --> 00:02:27,020
it can't find it anywhere because it doesn't exist.

35
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:33,010
In this case print is with a capitalized P.

36
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:34,830
And so I get this NameError.

37
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:36,820
And so it tells you

38
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,530
right here that if it's capitalized it's not defined.

39
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,728
So all we have to do is spell it right,

40
00:02:47,636 --> 00:02:50,130
With the proper capitalization and

41
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:54,867
then that works in It is common to make these typos where you are going

42
00:02:54,868 --> 00:03:00,520
to capitalize a start of a sentence, or that you will reverse letters.

43
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:03,620
You can look for that if you see a NameError.

44
00:03:03,621 --> 00:03:08,660
Another way the NameError can happen is if we have not defined something.

45
00:03:08,661 --> 00:03:10,940
So 'day_of_week' I am trying to print it, but

46
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:15,080
nowhere did I define "day_of_week", and so it says it cannot be found.

47
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:18,824
So the way to correct that is to define the variable.

48
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,112
So then we can run that.

49
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:33,700
Syntax errors are caused when we're not following the rules of Python.

50
00:03:33,701 --> 00:03:40,780
So if we're missing parentheses or quotes are not matching or

51
00:03:40,781 --> 00:03:44,740
you are just using things in the wrong order will get a syntax error.

52
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,270
Name error is when python can not find something, and so it could be.

53
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:53,270
Because by the fact you haven't initialized the code yet

54
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:57,280
maybe it 's further down in the code or you type the name of the code

55
00:03:57,281 --> 00:03:59,380
improperly and so Python can find it.

56
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,070
Good luck TroubleShooting your errors.
