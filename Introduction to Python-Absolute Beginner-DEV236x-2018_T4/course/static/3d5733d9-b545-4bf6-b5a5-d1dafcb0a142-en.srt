0
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,650
Now let's start taking steps that would

1
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:11,210
eventually help us build our first deep hero network.

2
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:16,681
We start again with our MNIST image,

3
00:00:16,681 --> 00:00:20,414
that is flattened into an array and

4
00:00:20,414 --> 00:00:24,670
is provided as an input into the model.

5
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:30,332
Now notice, in our logistic regression we directly

6
00:00:30,332 --> 00:00:35,094
mapped these inputs into the corresponding

7
00:00:35,094 --> 00:00:39,610
10 digits, 0,1 all the way till 9.

8
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:44,700
Here in deep networks, we will

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:50,190
put intermediate layers which enable us to

10
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:56,240
introduce interactions between the input features.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,060
In other words, what is the interaction between this pixel

12
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,390
and another pixels somewhere else or

13
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:05,200
this one against a boundary pixel?

14
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:10,180
So what we do is, we do not directly map

15
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,970
the inputs into the corresponding 10 digits.

16
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:19,948
What we would do is we will initially

17
00:01:19,948 --> 00:01:24,870
create another layer and in

18
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,460
this case we put say 400 nodes and this is a hyperparameter.

19
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:33,150
In other case in your model you will get to choose

20
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:38,130
how many nodes you want to build in the intermediate layers.

21
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:42,670
This is our first intermediate layer.

22
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:47,225
If you do not understand what intermediate means, just wait

23
00:01:47,225 --> 00:01:51,871
for the subsequent videos it'll become clear, but the first

24
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:56,516
thing in this building a deep network is to generate different

25
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:00,925
features that are built on top of the inputs that you give.

26
00:02:00,925 --> 00:02:06,076
So in this case, think about you take the input

27
00:02:06,076 --> 00:02:12,559
pixels here in your image and map it into 400 features.

28
00:02:12,559 --> 00:02:19,266
Now the output here would have a parameterization

29
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:23,265
of 400 activation units.

30
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:26,930
Here you know that these are called activations, and

31
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:30,930
different kinds of activation functions can be built in.

32
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:36,352
One of them you are already familiar is called sigmoid.

33
00:02:41,385 --> 00:02:44,352
We'll do a quick review of other options shortly.

34
00:02:47,857 --> 00:02:52,530
In this case since we are using 400 as my

35
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:57,205
intermediate feature representation,

36
00:02:57,205 --> 00:03:02,156
we will instead of 10 we'll have 400,

37
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:11,679
Vectors each of length 784 in my W matrix.

38
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:15,450
What would be the dimension of b?

39
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,910
Take a moment, think about it.

40
00:03:21,381 --> 00:03:25,827
If you followed the material in the course so far you would

41
00:03:25,827 --> 00:03:30,734
agree with that this would have the same dimension as the number

42
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:34,540
of division unit outputs that we choose to have,

43
00:03:35,909 --> 00:03:40,115
In this case it's 400.

44
00:03:40,115 --> 00:03:41,352
We call this the dense layer.

45
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:51,109
It is represented in subsequent, Videos and

46
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:54,520
the lecture set as this unit.

47
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:59,200
Here we have the input number of units that come into

48
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,450
the model as shown here.

49
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:11,780
And the output units which is 400 in this case.

50
00:04:14,901 --> 00:04:19,122
And the activation function we used in the past was sigmoid,

51
00:04:19,122 --> 00:04:23,344
but there're other options that I'll talk about in the next

52
00:04:23,344 --> 00:04:23,940
video.

53
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,349
We'll also represent sometimes the dense layer in a more

54
00:04:30,349 --> 00:04:33,120
compact way using this notation.
