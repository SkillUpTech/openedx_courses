Welcome to the course.

1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,483
In this course you are gonna learn the fundamentals of

2
00:00:07,483 --> 00:00:10,855
Deep Learning and where all it is being used.

3
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:14,704
At the end of the course you'll be able to build

4
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:18,260
Deep Learning technology based different

5
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:21,530
applications in an end to end fashion.

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:28,051
I'll explain to you whom this course is targeted towards, and

7
00:00:28,051 --> 00:00:32,318
will also walk you through what is expected from this course,

8
00:00:32,318 --> 00:00:35,786
and then move on to explain what is Deep Learning?

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:39,305
We'll relate to some of the background materials that we

10
00:00:39,305 --> 00:00:43,191
expect to be covered on machine learning, and then explaining

11
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:46,290
what all things we want to learn in Deep Learning.
