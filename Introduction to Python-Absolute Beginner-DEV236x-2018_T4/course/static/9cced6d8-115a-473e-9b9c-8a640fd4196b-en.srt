00:00:06,542 --> 00:00:11,311
We use comparison operators with if else statements to help make

1
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,824
decisions in code.

2
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:20,605
Here, we have an example where we use a x greater than 25 test.

3
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:25,675
If x is greater than 25, then we print x is already greater than 25.

4
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:30,858
If it's not true, if x is less or equal to 25, then we'll

5
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:36,162
execute our else statement and print what the value of x was.

6
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:40,260
And then assign it a new value of 26, and inform the user.

7
00:00:40,261 --> 00:00:41,060
Let's run that code.

8
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,410
So with x at 23, this evaluates to false or

9
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:49,518
not true, else statement runs.

10
00:00:51,995 --> 00:00:56,311
If we increase the value to larger than 25,

11
00:00:56,312 --> 00:01:01,660
sorry 26, then we see x is already greater than 25.

12
00:01:01,661 --> 00:01:05,061
We are using decisions in our code.

13
00:01:07,877 --> 00:01:13,309
In this example, we have a gameboard where the player position and

14
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,870
a trap position are set in the code.

15
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:21,660
We do an if statement checking if we're not in the trap.

16
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:25,470
If we're not in the trap and that's true, we keep playing.

17
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:29,810
If we're not in the trap false, that means we're in the trap and

18
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:31,390
then the game is over.

19
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:35,280
So let's start with position of 19 and the trap at 18, and

20
00:01:35,281 --> 00:01:36,730
we can keep playing.

21
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:39,700
And then if I put myself in the trap at position 18,

22
00:01:39,701 --> 00:01:41,240
then my game is over.

23
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,530
The last example uses the equal comparison operator.

24
00:01:46,531 --> 00:01:50,970
First, I use the single equals sign to set the value of my variable

25
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:52,370
x to 2.

26
00:01:52,371 --> 00:01:57,751
In my comparison statement, I just test if the value is equal to 2, and

27
00:01:57,752 --> 00:02:02,684
then I give the message about the double equals sign is the test for

28
00:02:02,685 --> 00:02:03,687
is equal to.

29
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:07,330
I use a pass statement if this value is not true.

30
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:14,040
So we have seen how we can use boolean comparison operators in our

31
00:02:14,041 --> 00:02:18,390
if else statements, and it really does help us make decisions and

32
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:19,560
make more interesting code.
