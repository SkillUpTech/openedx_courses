00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:06,700
Previously we ran into some type errors

1
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,040
when we try to concatenate strings

2
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:13,140
and numbers inside a print statements.

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:15,760
And we're going to see how we can fix that

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:20,130
using the comma format and it allows us to combine them easily.

5
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,870
So this is the old way that we would try

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,270
to combine these elements using the

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,550
addition and we know that we can't add

8
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,460
the strings and the numbers together and so,

9
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,500
we get that type error and so the way

10
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,240
that we can fix that is you could create

11
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,100
a string out of the number

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,840
or we could use a comma.

13
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:55,550
So this is a great improvement is now,

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,640
I'm allowed to legally combine a number

15
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,650
and a string in the same print statement.

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,510
So let's look below with a number variable.

17
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,040
So I have num error equals zero

18
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,600
and then I have this longish print statement

19
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,750
separated with commas using

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,490
the comma formatting and I have a string

21
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:27,070
int equals and then I have a literal number,

22
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,510
and then I have a literal string,

23
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:33,630
and then I have this number here as well

24
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:37,700
that is the variable number error which

25
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:40,220
would be zero and then followed with a string.

26
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:44,830
So I can alternate strings and numbers

27
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,540
or I can do variable numbers

28
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,220
and hard-coded numbers and let's see how that runs.

29
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,540
And so that works, my 14 shows up fine

30
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,170
and my number of zero errors came up

31
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:02,280
and indeed we got zero errors in that.

32
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,930
So in this lesson, we learned that we can

33
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:09,550
combine numbers with strings using

34
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,850
the comma print formatting and then that can

35
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:15,120
really speed up our display of information.
