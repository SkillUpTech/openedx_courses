0
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,057
Now that you are familiar with the LSTM blocks, how they can

1
00:00:05,057 --> 00:00:09,817
improve with longer sequences and dealing with a larger amount

2
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:14,395
of history, let's come back to our time-series problem,

3
00:00:14,395 --> 00:00:19,230
which has a much simpler representation of the data.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,361
We want to take away the complexities associated with

5
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:25,920
data for the learning purposes using this time series data.

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,466
We'll come back and bring back more different type of data

7
00:00:30,466 --> 00:00:35,027
representation later on in the course, in the model six.

8
00:00:35,027 --> 00:00:38,539
But for now, we're going to focus working with the time

9
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:42,286
series data, which is relatively simple numeric inputs.

10
00:00:42,286 --> 00:00:47,984
But understand how we can incorporate recurrence and

11
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:51,275
LSTMs in building a network and

12
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:56,213
predicting the output of our solar panel based

13
00:00:56,213 --> 00:01:00,780
on the recorded inputs over a span of time.

14
00:01:04,624 --> 00:01:09,206
So our input here is 14 data points represented in this

15
00:01:09,206 --> 00:01:13,550
pink window here, and these are our sequences.

16
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:19,940
And our output is gonna be a future value, one output value

17
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:24,400
of what the solar panel output would be at a future time.

18
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:32,588
Now that you have a notion of time, and

19
00:01:32,588 --> 00:01:36,812
the corresponding inputs in the form of a sequence,

20
00:01:36,812 --> 00:01:41,804
we can generate a recurrent time series with the LSTM units and

21
00:01:41,804 --> 00:01:45,360
then only project the last one to the dense.

22
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,020
Because we have one value to project and we take all the,

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,194
in this case, in this illustration,

24
00:01:53,194 --> 00:01:57,080
ten time stamps to predict a future value of Y.

25
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:02,926
It's very easy to do in the toolkit that we are gonna use

26
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:04,315
for the tutorial.

27
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:10,037
You can see that the first layer here defines the recurrence or

28
00:02:10,037 --> 00:02:13,510
the repetition of the LSTM units.

29
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:18,530
Then, we pick the last cell and pass it through the dense layer.

30
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:21,120
And in this case the output is going to be just one value.

31
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,220
And Z is going to be the output of the solar panel that we

32
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,956
are going to be using as a part of the exercises and

33
00:02:28,956 --> 00:02:30,978
tutorial in this module.
