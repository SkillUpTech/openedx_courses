00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,850
A common work flow for using Jupyter Notebooks for

1
00:00:06,851 --> 00:00:10,810
coding is to use Edit, Run and Save.

2
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,050
Some really common operations we're gonna use in our Jupyter notebooks

3
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:19,840
are edit, run, and save.

4
00:00:19,841 --> 00:00:23,360
So to edit a cell, and I'm talking about a code cell here,

5
00:00:23,361 --> 00:00:25,310
you can see this is a markdown cell.

6
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:29,320
Remember up here, and a code cell, if I highlight, is there.

7
00:00:29,321 --> 00:00:31,510
To edit, all I have to do is highlight in there, and

8
00:00:31,511 --> 00:00:33,230
you see my blinking cursor.

9
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:36,450
So I already had x = 2, let's go ahead and add to that.

10
00:00:36,451 --> 00:00:41,527
I'm gonna say that y is equal to x + 5,

11
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:46,920
and then I will look at how to run this.

12
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,730
And so if I run this cell, there's a couple ways I can do that.

13
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,260
First let's go to the menu and see Cell > Run Cells.

14
00:00:55,261 --> 00:00:56,810
And that has just run the cell.

15
00:00:56,811 --> 00:01:02,650
And what it does is put the value 2 in memory for

16
00:01:02,651 --> 00:01:10,250
x, and the value of 2 + 5, because that's x + 5 in the for y in memory.

17
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:12,980
And we don't see anything, so let's run it again so

18
00:01:12,981 --> 00:01:13,954
we can see something.

19
00:01:13,955 --> 00:01:15,560
So I'm just gonna put y there, and

20
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:21,250
all that's gonna do is say echo the value of y to the screen below here.

21
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,780
So let's go ahead and run that again, but

22
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:27,140
I'm not gonna hit Cell > Run Cells this time.

23
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:32,060
What I'm gonna do is just click into the cell, the code cell, and

24
00:01:32,061 --> 00:01:36,290
hit the Ctrl button, Ctrl+Enter.

25
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:40,300
And then we see that I have the value of 7 there.

26
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:43,688
I can edit again by highlighting it in there, and

27
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,845
I can add more to the equation.

28
00:01:45,846 --> 00:01:49,430
So I'm gonna add 3 more to the value of y.

29
00:01:49,431 --> 00:01:51,800
So I'm gonna expect 10 to come out.

30
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:58,945
And I can hit Ctrl+Enter again to run it, or I can hit Shift+Enter.

31
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:03,860
What Shift+Enter will do is move to the next cell, and

32
00:02:03,861 --> 00:02:06,620
if there's no cell below it will create a new cell.

33
00:02:06,621 --> 00:02:10,257
So we see that the cell was run because the value changed from

34
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,700
7 to 10, and then I have a new cell.

35
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:16,390
And all new cells always default to a code cell, and

36
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:18,960
our notebooks are still Python 3.

37
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:21,090
Now to save my work,

38
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:24,712
there is a Save button right there that will save that.

39
00:02:24,713 --> 00:02:27,520
It says Save and have a checkpoint so that next time,

40
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:30,850
when I open this notebook, it will still have

41
00:02:30,851 --> 00:02:35,840
the edited text that I put in right there and the new cell.

42
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:40,090
So we learned how to edit just by typing within the box.

43
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:43,412
All you need is the focus there to run using the menu, or

44
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:49,090
we can use Ctrl+Enter, or we can use Shift+Enter, which

45
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:53,070
we'll probably use the most because it will move us to the next cell.

46
00:02:53,071 --> 00:02:55,658
And then we can start working on the next cell and

47
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,219
keep running them in order.

48
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:59,560
And then to save we can push the Save button.
