00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:05,943
Welcome to the second module, this is gonna cover logistic

1
00:00:05,943 --> 00:00:09,988
regression and will introduce you to the framework.

2
00:00:09,988 --> 00:00:13,931
That we will be using throughout the course to understand and

3
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:15,412
build deep networks.

4
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:21,826
We will be using an application which is OCR,

5
00:00:21,826 --> 00:00:26,562
optical character recognition with a very popular database.

6
00:00:26,562 --> 00:00:29,739
That you probably have used as a part of your machine learning

7
00:00:29,739 --> 00:00:32,249
training, this is called the MNIST database.

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,743
We'll talk a little bit more about the database, but

9
00:00:35,743 --> 00:00:36,941
you have probably already seen

10
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:38,749
some of the images of the handwritten digits.

11
00:00:38,749 --> 00:00:41,647
So we are gonna build an application to recognize those

12
00:00:41,647 --> 00:00:42,910
digits in this course.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,670
The model, as the name of module suggests,

14
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:48,450
is gonna be logistic regression.

15
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,460
Some of you might be very familiar with binary

16
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:54,200
logistic regression, which is two classes.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,030
In this case,

18
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,357
we will do multiple classes which means that obviously,

19
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,422
the number of digits that we have range from 0 to 9.

20
00:01:01,422 --> 00:01:04,739
So having two classes that doesn't help, so we would be

21
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,206
figuring out how to use a logistic regression framework.

22
00:01:08,206 --> 00:01:12,833
To detect digits and we'll cover multiclass logistic regression,

23
00:01:12,833 --> 00:01:15,863
some of the concepts that you're gonna learn

24
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:18,585
here are gonna be loss and mini batches.

25
00:01:18,585 --> 00:01:21,757
Although I alluded to that in the previous module when

26
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:25,540
introducing you to the workflow for training and testing.

27
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:27,500
But we will repeat that and

28
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:31,400
get you introduced in a little bit more formal way, and

29
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,720
then the last one is gonna be a recurring theme.

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,143
Every module you will see, there's gonna be a train, test,

31
00:01:38,143 --> 00:01:42,200
predict, workflow which will show you how you can

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,480
combine different components together.

33
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,660
Almost like a Lego-like composability to

34
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,740
build this application end to end, train a model and

35
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,185
then test it out, and be ready to do predictions with them.
