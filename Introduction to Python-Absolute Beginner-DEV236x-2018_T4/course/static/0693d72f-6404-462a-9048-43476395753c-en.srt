Do you know what an elif statement is?

1
00:00:06,521 --> 00:00:09,344
Elif in Python is an else if statement and

2
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:12,593
it allows us to test for multiple conditions.

3
00:00:12,594 --> 00:00:18,711
Elif in this example will allow us to check for four different cases.

4
00:00:18,712 --> 00:00:22,829
Whether the weather is sunny, rainy, snowy, or

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,254
if we put in another entry that we don't understand.

6
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:30,067
Let's look at the example in the very

7
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:33,350
simplest case with just the if statement.

8
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:39,160
If the weather, this input that we got right here,

9
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:43,583
is equal to sunny, then we're gonna print wear a t-shirt.

10
00:00:43,584 --> 00:00:47,343
If we wanna check for rainy, else would not work for us,

11
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:51,360
cuz it could also be snowy entered, or some invalid input.

12
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:54,910
So we use the elif statement.

13
00:00:54,911 --> 00:00:58,253
This first elif checks if it's raining.

14
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:02,065
The second elif checks if its snowy.

15
00:01:02,066 --> 00:01:05,524
Then finally we get to our else statement,

16
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:09,560
where its none of the three cases we checked for and

17
00:01:09,561 --> 00:01:13,324
we just say we don't understand the message.

18
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:14,069
Let's run the code.

19
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,288
I'll try sunny first.

20
00:01:22,064 --> 00:01:25,670
It says to wear a t-shirt, so we went through this path.

21
00:01:25,671 --> 00:01:27,262
Let's run it again.

22
00:01:31,604 --> 00:01:35,320
It's snowy, we went through this path.

23
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,770
This was not true, if statement.

24
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,479
The elif statement was not true, rainy.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,132
The elif statement for snowy was true, and we printed our message.

26
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:54,330
So we can control the flow through many paths using elif.

27
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:58,897
The other example's very similar.

28
00:01:58,898 --> 00:02:03,286
It just uses the elif statement to see if we're guessing a number

29
00:02:03,287 --> 00:02:04,108
properly.

30
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,327
So we put in a secret number, and then we tell

31
00:02:09,328 --> 00:02:14,272
the individuals to guess 1, 2, or 3.

32
00:02:14,273 --> 00:02:17,700
If its not a digit, then we say, they need to put in a digit.

33
00:02:17,701 --> 00:02:22,920
So this case checks if it's a letter or some other non digit.

34
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:26,465
If they guess 1, we tell them they guessed too low.

35
00:02:26,466 --> 00:02:29,925
If they guess the secret number, we tell them that it's right.

36
00:02:29,926 --> 00:02:32,320
If they guess 3, we tell them too high.

37
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:37,079
And otherwise, we say it's not a valid guess in the range.

38
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,838
Let's run the code.

39
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:44,649
If we enter a typed, Three in letters,

40
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:49,897
we should get the message that it's a invalid guess.

41
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:50,584
And we do.

42
00:02:50,585 --> 00:02:54,559
And that means this statement here executed.

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,752
It checked if it's a digit, and because if is.digit was false,

44
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:02,496
then that executes it matched.

45
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:04,347
.isdigit()== False;.

46
00:03:04,348 --> 00:03:06,139
Yes, then run this code.

47
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,107
Let's try another test.

48
00:03:15,924 --> 00:03:19,859
Here we gotta to run the third elif statement.

49
00:03:22,922 --> 00:03:26,470
Using the elif statement, we can check for multiple conditions.
