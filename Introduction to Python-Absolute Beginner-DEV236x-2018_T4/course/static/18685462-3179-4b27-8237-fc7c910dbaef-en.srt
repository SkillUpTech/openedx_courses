0
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,220
Let's begin with understanding what

1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,910
the MNIST database provides with regards to handwritten digits.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:15,150
So on the left here, you see these

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,200
are the images of different digits written by hand.

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,180
You can see that the same image,

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,620
like the digit 3 is written in three different ways here.

6
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:25,950
And we want to detect

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,580
what those digits are in a machine readable format, so

8
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,880
this is an application called optical character recognition.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,400
And this application was originally used to

10
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,360
recognize handwritten post codes.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,581
So the data set has handwritten digits of 0 to 9,

12
00:00:43,581 --> 00:00:47,520
and there are 60,000 training images.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,450
Needless to say, there are multiple repetitions of

14
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:53,130
the same digits like you see here, 3, 3, 3.

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:56,570
There might be however many 0s and so on and so

16
00:00:56,570 --> 00:01:00,950
forth for all the represented digits from 0 to 9.

17
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:06,730
And then, there are 10,000 test images, and

18
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:12,990
each image here represents an array of 28 by 28 numbers and

19
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,120
in image terminology they are called 28 by 28 pixels.
