Here are the references we have used for this course.

1
00:00:03,823 --> 00:00:08,295
We start with a great book by Goodfellow, Bengio, and

2
00:00:08,295 --> 00:00:11,125
Courville titled Deep Learning.

3
00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:15,886
Standford CS231N course also has a wealth of information

4
00:00:15,886 --> 00:00:20,730
that has been very relevant in preparing this course.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,770
And finally, the tutorials on neural networks by Geoff Hinton.

6
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,026
I'd like to acknowledge, Chris Basoglu and

7
00:00:29,026 --> 00:00:33,700
Cha Zhang, Microsoft for their support and

8
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,470
improvement throughout the development of the course.

9
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:42,278
I'd like to extend my thanks to Surya Pathak,

10
00:00:42,278 --> 00:00:44,930
Professor at the University of Washington for

11
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,190
helping out the pedagogical approach to teaching and

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,300
changes to the content to reflect those.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,920
Jonathan Sanito, who is Content Developer at Microsoft for

14
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,510
his assistance with graphics, and later on in the course

15
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:01,305
you'll see especially in the convolutional networks.

16
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:06,553
Nikos Karampatziakis, my colleague, for help with

17
00:01:06,553 --> 00:01:10,431
the tutorials associated with text classification.
