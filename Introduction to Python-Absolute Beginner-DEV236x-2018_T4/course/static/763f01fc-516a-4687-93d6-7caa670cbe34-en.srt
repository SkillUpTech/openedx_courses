Boolean String Methods such as isalpha or

1
00:00:07,004 --> 00:00:14,490
isnum can be used to control our flow of code in an if statement.

2
00:00:14,491 --> 00:00:18,590
We can use any Boolean String Method in an if statement because they all

3
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:20,399
resolve to either true or false.

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,670
In our example, we get input for the title of a book and

5
00:00:25,671 --> 00:00:28,040
save that in favorite_book.

6
00:00:28,041 --> 00:00:31,060
Then we use the istitle method

7
00:00:31,061 --> 00:00:35,210
to see if it's a title case where every word is capitalized.

8
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:40,500
If that result is true, then we'll print nice capitalization.

9
00:00:40,501 --> 00:00:42,964
If not true, we'll go to the else statement and

10
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:45,435
we'll give them a tip to capitalize each word.

11
00:00:48,409 --> 00:00:50,360
We run the code and I'll put in a title.

12
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:01,255
It says nice capitalization because I put in each word capitalized.

13
00:01:05,396 --> 00:01:08,097
If I'll just put in something without capitalization,

14
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:09,060
it gives me the tip.

15
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,376
So this resolve do not true.

16
00:01:15,598 --> 00:01:20,160
In the next example, we want to enter a positive integer and

17
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:23,000
then we run the check, is it a digit.

18
00:01:25,354 --> 00:01:30,651
This is a good check because if we're looking for a number input,

19
00:01:30,652 --> 00:01:35,177
then if someone puts in something that's not a number or

20
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:37,505
the positive digit we want,

21
00:01:42,058 --> 00:01:48,550
Then we see that a text string is not an integer.

22
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:52,983
We can also run more than one if statement at a time.

23
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:59,577
After this first if statement runs,

24
00:01:59,578 --> 00:02:04,700
I can run a second one to check if it's a alphabetical character.

25
00:02:04,701 --> 00:02:07,700
And if it is, we can tell people that that's a word and

26
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,550
that we're looking for a number input.

27
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:12,834
So I can try again.

28
00:02:14,104 --> 00:02:17,348
And that it says number is not a positive integer,

29
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,132
number is more like a word.

30
00:02:21,691 --> 00:02:26,833
So we can use our Boolean string test to evaluate if statements and

31
00:02:26,834 --> 00:02:29,180
control the flow of our code.
