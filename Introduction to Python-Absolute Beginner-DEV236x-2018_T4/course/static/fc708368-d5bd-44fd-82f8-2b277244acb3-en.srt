00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:04,800
In this module, we will start with reviewing two applications

1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,980
that have made convolution networks very very popular.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:10,390
The first one, image tagging.

3
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:15,260
You take an image and you give it to this trained model.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,330
It will emit different labels that

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,700
are associated with this image and those are the image tags.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:27,270
In here you can see that this is the image of a leopard

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,290
and the top five categories predicted are pretty

8
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:35,030
reasonably good, with the first one being spot on being leopard.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:38,150
So this is part of a work that was done by

10
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:43,110
Alex Krizhevsky's and Hinton's research group in Toronto,

11
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:45,380
the paper is referenced here.

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,840
And it builds on top of a very popular data cell

13
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,220
called ImageNet.

14
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:55,480
And it has led to groundbreaking research and

15
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,709
breakthroughs in the area of deep learning.

16
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:03,340
Once you have tagged an image with the different tags.

17
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,650
The next task that automatically comes in your mind is,

18
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,550
where are these images.

19
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,420
Where are these objects located?

20
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:14,120
In this other application, which you'll see here,

21
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,140
we call it object detection.

22
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:21,690
The different components in the image are not only tagged but

23
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:24,010
also their bounding boxes are predicted.

24
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:30,672
This is a tutorial that is available on our CNTK

25
00:01:30,672 --> 00:01:36,842
website which does object detection using Fast R-CNN.

26
00:01:36,842 --> 00:01:40,188
This is hugely popular for many practical applications in

27
00:01:40,188 --> 00:01:43,460
the domain built on top of image-based data.

28
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:47,722
Here you can see that within a refrigerator we are able to

29
00:01:47,722 --> 00:01:51,258
detect that this is a bottle of orange juice and

30
00:01:51,258 --> 00:01:55,540
this is some egg cartons in here, and so on and so forth.
