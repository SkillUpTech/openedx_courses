    "Now let's start taking steps that would", 
    "eventually help us build our first deep hero network.", 
    "We start again with our MNIST image,", 
    "that is flattened into an array and", 
    "is provided as an input into the model.", 
    "Now notice, in our logistic regression we directly", 
    "mapped these inputs into the corresponding", 
    "10 digits, 0,1 all the way till 9.", 
    "Here in deep networks, we will", 
    "put intermediate layers which enable us to", 
    "introduce interactions between the input features.", 
    "In other words, what is the interaction between this pixel", 
    "and another pixels somewhere else or", 
    "this one against a boundary pixel?", 
    "So what we do is, we do not directly map", 
    "the inputs into the corresponding 10 digits.", 
    "What we would do is we will initially", 
    "create another layer and in", 
    "this case we put say 400 nodes and this is a hyperparameter.", 
    "In other case in your model you will get to choose", 
    "how many nodes you want to build in the intermediate layers.", 
    "This is our first intermediate layer.", 
    "If you do not understand what intermediate means, just wait", 
    "for the subsequent videos it'll become clear, but the first", 
    "thing in this building a deep network is to generate different", 
    "features that are built on top of the inputs that you give.", 
    "So in this case, think about you take the input", 
    "pixels here in your image and map it into 400 features.", 
    "Now the output here would have a parameterization", 
    "of 400 activation units.", 
    "Here you know that these are called activations, and", 
    "different kinds of activation functions can be built in.", 
    "One of them you are already familiar is called sigmoid.", 
    "We'll do a quick review of other options shortly.", 
    "In this case since we are using 400 as my", 
    "intermediate feature representation,", 
    "we will instead of 10 we'll have 400,", 
    "Vectors each of length 784 in my W matrix.", 
    "What would be the dimension of b?", 
    "Take a moment, think about it.", 
    "If you followed the material in the course so far you would", 
    "agree with that this would have the same dimension as the number", 
    "of division unit outputs that we choose to have,", 
    "In this case it's 400.", 
    "We call this the dense layer.", 
    "It is represented in subsequent, Videos and", 
    "the lecture set as this unit.", 
    "Here we have the input number of units that come into", 
    "the model as shown here.", 
    "And the output units which is 400 in this case.", 
    "And the activation function we used in the past was sigmoid,", 
    "but there're other options that I'll talk about in the next", 
    "video.", 
    "We'll also represent sometimes the dense layer in a more", 
    "compact way using this notation."
