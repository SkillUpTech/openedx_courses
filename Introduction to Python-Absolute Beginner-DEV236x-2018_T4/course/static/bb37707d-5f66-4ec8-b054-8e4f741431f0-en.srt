00:00:03,091 --> 00:00:06,854
The addition operator can do math and numbers,

1
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:12,060
such as energies and floats, or it can concatenate strings.

2
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:12,740
Let's take a look.

3
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,300
Here, I just have a simple math equation, 19 + 3.

4
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:21,634
And if we echo to the screen by running it,

5
00:00:21,635 --> 00:00:24,070
we see we can get an answer there.

6
00:00:24,071 --> 00:00:26,843
You can change the numbers and use this as your own calculator.

7
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,109
I can also use this to add float numbers.

8
00:00:35,789 --> 00:00:37,690
And that also shows the result below.

9
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:41,390
So this is a typical mathematical operation, and

10
00:00:41,391 --> 00:00:43,069
use this just like you would in your math.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,410
We can also add strings.

12
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:50,310
Here, I have two strings, my name + Allysa.

13
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,450
If I echo that below, it displays as a single string.

14
00:00:55,451 --> 00:00:58,260
We can also put these within a print function.

15
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,143
I can do the math operation in the print function and

16
00:01:02,144 --> 00:01:03,557
the result can display.

17
00:01:06,425 --> 00:01:11,290
I can put a number of strings and concatenate them using

18
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:16,170
the + operator, and they display as a single string.

19
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,920
The additional operator allows us to do math additions with numbers or

20
00:01:22,921 --> 00:01:24,440
to concatenate strings.
