00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:03,490
This is introduction of Python, unit one.

1
00:00:03,490 --> 00:00:07,915
I am your instructor, Eric Camplin, a Content Developer at Microsoft.

2
00:00:07,915 --> 00:00:11,550
I&#39;m excited to present this course designed for

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,880
those who are new to programming, to ease into learning Python.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,760
The student will cover basic programming concepts and

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,350
do exercises that can be completed online using the Jupyter Notebook

6
00:00:23,350 --> 00:00:27,550
development environment hosted on Microsoft Azure.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,690
Unit one focuses on Python Language Basics.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:34,520
Student would be able to develop and run programs in Jupyter Notebooks

9
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,440
that utilize concepts as data types, variables, user input,

10
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,326
they&#39;ll build functions, use operators and conditional statements.

11
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:46,700
We&#39;ll build while loops and increment variables, and

12
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:49,260
we&#39;ll delve into troubleshooting errors.

13
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,330
All key foundations to further learning in computer science.

14
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:57,500
Each concept introduced has a video, and examples, and

15
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:03,020
student coding task, and followed by additional programming practice.

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,860
With the modules, there are multiple sections that have knowledge checks

17
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:09,520
and end of module coding assignments.

18
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,090
At the end, there is a final coding project.

19
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:15,308
For those pursuing the verified certificate,

20
00:01:15,308 --> 00:01:19,360
70% credit is required for passing.

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,418
Welcome to the course.
