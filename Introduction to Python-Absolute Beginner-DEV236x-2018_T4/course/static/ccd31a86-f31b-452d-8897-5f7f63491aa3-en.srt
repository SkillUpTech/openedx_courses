So welcome to the Cognitive Toolkit that we will be using

1
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,870
for this course.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,470
You can find a lot of information at this Wiki site,

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,050
including how to set up your machines locally.

4
00:00:14,050 --> 00:00:17,150
You'll be getting some additional

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:19,770
information as a part of the course material.

6
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,480
But we will be using this particular Toolkit for

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,528
doing your homework assignments, and

8
00:00:24,528 --> 00:00:27,220
the lab exercises that come along with it.

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:33,770
We also encourage you to ask questions on

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,840
Stack Overflow with the tag CNTK as you run into issues.

11
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,794
And we will be able to answer your inquiries as you go through

12
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:44,993
this course.
