    "So now you know that, if we continue to", 
    "connect all the image pixels even using", 
    "this patching scheme which takes into", 
    "account the neighbourhood adjacency", 
    "of the pixels. We end up having a huge", 
    "number of parameters in our network.", 
    "So what I mean by that here, let's go back a little bit", 
    "and see as we scan through the image,", 
    "each time we are learning a new set of weights.", 
    "And that leads to a huge explosion in the number of", 
    "parameters that we need to estimate.", 
    "Convolution Networks is somewhat key", 
    "to understanding how we can build deep networks.", 
    "What we will do here is again do the scanning except for the fact that", 
    "the Kernel weights that are being learned get updated", 
    "every time we run the kernel through the entire image.", 
    "In other words in a Convolutional layer, a single set of weights", 
    "is being shared by all output nodes within the current filter.", 
    "So consequently the values that get", 
    "updated are only these three times, three values of the same weight matrix", 
    "and the bias ofcourse. So with that for a filter shape of 3x3", 
    "we have to learn only ten parameters.", 
    "Now what we can do is try to train as many filters as possible.", 
    "Now you would imagine that if I trained", 
    "another filter, how would it be different", 
    "from this filter. But remember during the", 
    "initialization phase of our convolution operation", 
    "this is applicable to the", 
    "dense network as well. But in Convolution even more so", 
    "that you would have multiple filters each of them would be", 
    "initialized to a different value. OK.", 
    "So you would have the first kernel", 
    "that would have learned something about", 
    "maybe the brightness of the image.", 
    "Then you would have the second kernel, the orange one", 
    "which would have learned something about", 
    "maybe the contrast of the edges.", 
    "And so and so forth you will build", 
    "n filters. The total number of parameters", 
    "for this filter set with n filters would", 
    "be 9 times n plus n, a much smaller number.", 
    "So in case of a 3x3 filter with 5 layers", 
    "this would have 10 parameters,", 
    "you would get about 500 parameters. OK.", 
    "With larger images the number of parameters", 
    "doesn't increase anymore. So instead of", 
    "39 million you would get something like", 
    "a thousand parameters. What does it let us do?", 
    "It allows us to handle larger images", 
    "trying larger filters, this allows us", 
    "to learn more different kinds of", 
    "spatial correlations, a relationship between the pixels within the patch.", 
    "The patch is larger, we can learn more number of filters.", 
    "So these can detect different", 
    "kinds of relationship between the", 
    "different patches and also", 
    "deeper architecture with may be as high as 150", 
    "odd layers. So what are these layers learning?", 
    "Let's talk about the some of the first few layers", 
    "we call the primitive features, they learn the edges.", 
    "You can see that here it has learned", 
    "how to detect the edge in this direction", 
    "and this one has learned in that direction", 
    "so and so forth. OK.", 
    "If it was a color image you would have learned", 
    "some of the color features and the", 
    "deeper layers learn how to use these", 
    "primitive features and detect more", 
    "complex features like corners or combinations of", 
    "different patches and different localized features in the image itself."
