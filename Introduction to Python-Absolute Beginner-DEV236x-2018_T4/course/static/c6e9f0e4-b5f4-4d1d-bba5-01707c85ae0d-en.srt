00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:07,440
Let's look at improving our input messages

1
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,500
by using the input prompt mechanism

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:12,770
and simplify things a little bit.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:16,450
Previously we used a message

4
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:20,840
to the user in a print statement and then we put in our input.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:24,050
Well, that's fine but we have

6
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,760
this message up here  and then below, I have to

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,100
put in my answer and when I

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,410
improve this with by using  the input prompt,

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:37,420
I can just do it all on a single line.

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:41,370
So, inside of the parenthesis,  I'm allowed to

11
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,920
put in a message, in a string.

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,240
And so that will be displayed to the user

13
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:49,250
and we're going to see right here

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,370
that if I run that now,  the prompt message

15
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:57,890
that is inside the parenthesis  of the input function

16
00:00:58,230 --> 00:01:00,120
is displayed and then I can

17
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:02,880
enter a name in there.

18
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,420
And now, that is assigned to student name

19
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:11,420
and I get my name out here. So, let's going forward

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,770
just use the input prompt and that will

21
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:16,200
simplify things and you keep the prompt

22
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,710
with your input statement.

23
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:20,510
Another thing that we really need to

24
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:24,910
look at here is that when we enter in

25
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,220
the student name input, we want to know

26
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,440
what kind of type that is.

27
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:42,690
And we see that, that is a type string.

28
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:46,970
So, that is a string because it's a name

29
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,910
and we would expect that to be a string.

30
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,280
But let's look back at our initial example

31
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:59,170
here with small int. What is that?

32
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,530
Well it's also a string.

33
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:07,490
So, no matter what your intent is  whether you want

34
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:14,340
this to be a numeric value or a string value,

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,090
it's always going to be a string.

36
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:20,530
And so this is a digit 3 which is

37
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,720
the same as 3 in quotes.

38
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,770
This is rather than the numeric 3. So we would not

39
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,010
be able to add together three plus three.

40
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:35,900
So, what we've learned is that, we can use

41
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,420
the input prompt that's built into the

42
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,520
input statement by typing inside the

43
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,480
parenthesis and that no matter what

44
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,440
no matter what we type in

45
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:48,510
to the input statement is always going to be a string.
