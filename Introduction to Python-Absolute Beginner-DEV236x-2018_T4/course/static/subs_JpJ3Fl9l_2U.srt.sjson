    "Welcome to the lab for module five,", 
    "here we will get a Hands-on experience", 
    "with Time series modeling using Recurrence.", 
    "And the recurrent cells that you'll be using would be the LSTM blocks,", 
    "that we have talked during the video lectures.", 
    "Let's get started. So I have the code here in this folder Edx", 
    "and you can see all my labs are here, what I'm going to do now is I have", 
    "activated the environment here using", 
    "source activates cntk-py35 on linux or activate cntk-py35", 
    "on Windows. And then I am going to launch my Jupiter environment.", 
    "And if you are using the Azure environment, Azure notebooks.", 
    "Then it would be simply launching those notebooks", 
    "in the Azure notebook portal", 
    "and we are going to use the Lab5 here.", 
    "We will walk you through Time series predictions with LSTMs,", 
    "we will use the same IOT Data from the solar panel.", 
    "Example :that we have been using our in our lectures.", 
    "So this is the solar panel that we are using for", 
    "our exemplar data set. Each of these solar panel", 
    "emit how much electricity they are generating on a periodical basis.", 
    "However you'll see that not always all the panels would", 
    "record what they are generating,", 
    "so we have to deal with some missing data and which is part of the data set here.", 
    "So we have recordings from the solar panel on a half hourly basis", 
    "and we also know the total output of the solar panel for a given day.", 
    "So in this lab, what we will do is walk you through the following steps,", 
    "set up you're already familiar with by now,", 
    "so we will not go into it too much.", 
    "We will talk a little bit about Data generation.", 
    "A lot of time can be spent in Data generation,", 
    "when you are dealing with machine learning and deep learning.", 
    "It's good to understand what the data looks like and how you want to", 
    "process that before you want to start modeling.", 
    "With the process data we are going to start modeling our LSTM Network", 
    "and then conclude the lab with the Train test and prediction workflow.", 
    "We import different components, different packages from the Python", 
    "and in the pyplot different packages in the Python environment", 
    "pandas in particular we will be using it I will point you to it,", 
    "when we get to that particular part of the lab and we import cntk.", 
    "Here are some of the code that is used for testing these notebooks", 
    "and is not particularly relevant for the lab,", 
    "but we just ignore this for in the moment.", 
    "We ensure here that the environment that you're running is", 
    "using CNTKs released version 2.0.", 
    "This notebook actually takes a fair bit of computation", 
    "and to let us run this notebook in a relatively quick time frame,", 
    "we set this flag to be true.", 
    "However, I would encourage you to also try out by setting", 
    "this flag False and see how much", 
    "difference you see at the end of the", 
    "runs between the fast mode and the fast mode being set to True,", 
    "and the fast mode set to False. Let's take a look at the", 
    "Data generation. So, you have solar panel", 
    "which emits two measures and 30-minute interval.", 
    "We have the solar.current which is", 
    "the reported value of current produced,", 
    "by the solar panel and solar.total is the", 
    "total produced for the day in watts/hour.", 
    "So here, what you see is at 7am, the solar.current reading", 
    "and that solar.total,", 
    "and you have a series of these values", 
    "reported in your IOT data,", 
    "that is streaming from those solar panels.", 
    "What we will do then is, we start to process the data,", 
    "pre-process this in such a way that", 
    "we can then use it for modeling.", 
    "We read data into pandas data frame and I do recommend using", 
    "pandas dataframe for", 
    "doing a lot of reading of data that can", 
    "be read in chunks and you want to", 
    "process them it-- is a convenient package,", 
    "that allows you to process the data very efficiently", 
    "and saves you a lot of time.", 
    "We will then normalize the data, remember", 
    "in the MNIST data we had scaled the digits", 
    "between 0 and 1. Similarly, here we are", 
    "going to normalize the data, within a 0 to 1 range.", 
    "Then we want to group the data by the day.", 
    "And finally we want to", 
    "append the column - solar.current.max,", 
    "and solar.total.max and generate the sequence for each day.", 
    "Now, let's see what those sequences look like.", 
    "So, the measurements for a day", 
    "are grouped into a set of sequences like shown here,", 
    "and correspond-- each of them corresponds", 
    "to the measurement for a day. So in here, you can", 
    "see, these are the two readings that are", 
    "available to us and the total that were", 
    "generated for that particular day is 10300.", 
    "As more and more recordings come in from that particular solar panel,", 
    "for a given day, you can see", 
    "that more and more readings are getting", 
    "accumulated but the output of the solar panel--  total output", 
    "from the solar panel remains the same. Remember, some of these readings", 
    "may be missing or may not be available,", 
    "because the solar panel didn't", 
    "report those readings for that particular", 
    "time point and we have to deal with those kind of situations.", 
    "Now, our sequence would be one of these", 
    "instances here. For instance, there would be some anywhere between", 
    "8 to14 recordings in our dataset,", 
    "when we have finally processed it and cleansed it", 
    "and the corresponding. So that would be your", 
    "the X - the input and the Y would be", 
    "the total current that is generated", 
    "by the solar panel for that particular day.", 
    "Now, why I said 8 to 14 is that, if we", 
    "have less than 8 data points, for any", 
    "particular day, then we skip that", 
    "pretty skip that data point all together", 
    "because it's very unpredictable", 
    "and what's going on that particular---", 
    "it is very unpredictable, what is going", 
    "on that particular day and it could be", 
    "that many of the solar panels stopped", 
    "functioning and stopped reporting.", 
    "So that would lead to a different workflow", 
    "if you were to build an application", 
    "where you would send an alert saying", 
    "that you have fewer than 8 data points", 
    "being recorded, so there might be", 
    "something that is going on either the", 
    "solar panel is flaky or something's going", 
    "wrong and if we get more than 14 data", 
    "points we are also truncating it in this", 
    "case because we feel that 14 data points", 
    "more than adequate for us to be able", 
    "to predict what the output of the solar", 
    "panel would be for that particular day.", 
    "These data sets are available in a", 
    "comma-separated value file and what we", 
    "do here in this function, we the function", 
    "generate_solar_data, we take the URL as an input where", 
    "the data lies and here you can see that", 
    "it's solar.csv once you run the", 
    "notebook you will be able to see where", 
    "it downloaded, let's see so in this case", 
    "my data should have been downloaded", 
    "because I've already run the notebook", 
    "you can see under the iot folder here, I", 
    "have that solar.csv file. You can", 
    "investigate that file what's in there", 
    "and understand what is the input to this", 
    "pre-processing function. We use the", 
    "pandas read_csv functionality to read", 
    "the data and then we do a normalization", 
    "like I was talking about this is", 
    "important for our models to function", 
    "well where we compress the data into a", 
    "range of 0 to 1 and then we group the", 
    "data by the date or for a given date.", 
    "Once we have the sequences", 
    "these sequences collated", 
    "that becomes our input here X and the", 
    "corresponding Y, let me draw it here.", 
    "So this becomes our X and this is becomes Y."
