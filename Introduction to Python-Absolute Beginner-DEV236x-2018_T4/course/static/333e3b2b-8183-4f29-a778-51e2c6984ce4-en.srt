00:00:03,233 --> 00:00:07,620
We'll use the hashtag in Python to create comments.

1
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:10,060
>> Good code is commented code.

2
00:00:10,061 --> 00:00:13,551
In this version of the Hello World program, we use the hashtag or

3
00:00:13,552 --> 00:00:16,250
the pound sign to enter a comment.

4
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:17,900
Tells the user about the code.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,616
Also in this course, we'll use a lot of messages for

6
00:00:23,617 --> 00:00:26,581
the student in the cells using a comment.

7
00:00:26,582 --> 00:00:33,563
We'll use this symbol to signify that the user has some task.

8
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:37,472
And we'll give instructions on how to run the cells in examples

9
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:38,070
as well.
