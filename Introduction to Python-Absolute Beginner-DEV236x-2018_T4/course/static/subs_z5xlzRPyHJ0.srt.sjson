    "Now that you are quite familiar with the convolution operations,", 
    "let's put together a pure convolutional network.", 
    "We start with our MNIST image of digit 3.", 
    "This is a greyscale image, so we specify the input", 
    "with the dimensions of 1, 28, 28.", 
    "And we're gonna use a filter size of 5 by 5,", 
    "and we're gonna learn eight filters.", 
    "We'll keep a stride of two.", 
    "We'll set padding equals true.", 
    "And we'll use activation equals value.", 
    "At the end of this operation, when the image is processed,", 
    "you will get eight 14 times 14 images.", 
    "And then that becomes the input to the next layer.", 
    "And in this layer, we're gonna keep the filter sizes the same,", 
    "but the number of output filters we're gonna increase to 16.", 
    "We'll keep rest of the parameters the same.", 
    "This is the trend that you will notice, that,", 
    "in convolutional network, that as you go build the layers,", 
    "you tend to squeeze the image, the image sizes themselves will", 
    "start getting smaller but the number of filters", 
    "that you'll learn keeps getting deeper and deeper.", 
    "So this is a key aspect of convolutional network", 
    "where you keep squeezing the image.", 
    "In this case we have only a 28 by 28 image,", 
    "so you can only do it so much.", 
    "But if you have a larger image, you can do a whole lot of things", 
    "by playing around with these parameters.", 
    "So the end of the second convolutional layer here,", 
    "we have seven by seven and 16 of these here.", 
    "So we would flatten that out at this stage into array, and", 
    "map these values into output layer of 10 vectors.", 
    "We need to get into this vector size of 10,", 
    "because ultimate goal for us in this case is to characterize", 
    "each of the images that are coming in as input", 
    "to the corresponding digits from zero to nine.", 
    "And, indeed once you ride this network and", 
    "you run to a set of images you'll, for the m nest data,", 
    "you will see that the output comes like a vector", 
    "of 10 numbers with the largest number", 
    "being the value corresponding to the digit three.", 
    "And this is what the code for", 
    "that particular network would look like.", 
    "Here you can see it's a one-to-one", 
    "correspondence between this diagram.", 
    "Here the convolutional layer, this is the second convolutional", 
    "layer, and then there's this dense layer.", 
    "And with this type of network, when you run it through, you", 
    "will see the error rate for the MNIST data goes down to 1.56.", 
    "Significant jump from LR.", 
    "If you've done the homework, the assignment for the feed", 
    "forward network, you will see that this is an improvement", 
    "over the multi-layer perceptron based network that we had.", 
    "And we'll see how we can further reduce this error rate in", 
    "the next several videos."
