We've learned how to combine strings

1
00:00:06,530 --> 00:00:10,500
inside a print statements, using string addition with plus sign.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,830
So, let's look at another way to do some

3
00:00:12,890 --> 00:00:16,560
formatting with print and we can combine using commas.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,080
So I'm going to just create a string variable here,

5
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:27,120
and enter the Name: Collette, I need to run that cell so that

6
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,640
that variable name gets populated with the string

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,820
and then I can go over here

8
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:36,700
and this is the familiar print statement we used before, we used

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,740
a string and then we just add in a variable,

10
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:45,120
that is a string and then we add a another string.

11
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,440
And I can run that cell.

12
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,900
Now, I got my "Hello Collette!" but,

13
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,620
this-- printing with, formatting with

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,820
commas is a different way to do this

15
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,200
and so, what I can do is, put a

16
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,340
comma between the different strings. And so,

17
00:01:04,460 --> 00:01:05,420
I've done here.

18
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:09,870
"Hello to" be Collette again, "who is from our city".

19
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,520
And I can run that string,

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,740
and you can see here that concatenates

21
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,000
all of the strings inside this print statement

22
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,720
in between the commas,

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,420
it just puts a space in between there and that's a default behavior.

24
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,500
So, it says "Hello to", add in a space

25
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,140
"Collette" added in a space whose from our city.

26
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,640
So we can print format with commas,

27
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,660
and concatenate strings very quickly

28
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,080
just by putting them next to each other,

29
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,800
using the comma for different string variables or literal strings.
