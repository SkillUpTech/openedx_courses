00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:04,540
Let me first introduce you the concept of sequences.

1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,750
There are different types of sequences that you'll run into.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,540
And in this module I'll introduce you to a couple of

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:11,630
them that we will use.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:17,350
The first one, the problem said we will use

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:19,930
the time series prediction with IOT data.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:25,730
We'll have multiple inputs coming into the models, and

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,000
we will predict a future value around those inputs.

8
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,390
In this case, the pink buckets are the inputs, and

9
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,700
the blue bucket is the output in this case

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:43,350
a forecasting based on the empty data and the green

11
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,160
blocks are the models that we will build with recurrence.

12
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,470
If this is not familiar to you these will become very clear

13
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,770
towards the end of the module.

14
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,910
And this motif is popularly called many to one,

15
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,170
popularized by Andrej Karpathy from Stanford.

16
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:04,450
One thing you'll notice is that in the previous modules,

17
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:06,180
we had the inputs coming from the top.

18
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,000
Now we will have the inputs coming in the bottom following

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,180
this particular motif that Andrej has.

20
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,240
And the output will be at the top.

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,920
So let's see what it means in the context of the solar

22
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,240
panel data.

23
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,740
So the solar panel data that we have

24
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:26,570
are the recordings from the solar panel for

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:30,550
the 14 data points that are captured in this pink window.

26
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,540
And we will build a model and this is gonna be

27
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:39,770
called the recurrent model where Rec stands for recurrence.

28
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:41,300
We'll explain to you what those mean.

29
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,393
And based on that model,

30
00:01:45,393 --> 00:01:49,836
it will generate a future prediction of what the solar

31
00:01:49,836 --> 00:01:53,800
panel total output is gonna be at a future time.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:58,725
So in this case, based on this pink window the input here,

33
00:01:58,725 --> 00:02:02,947
we'll predict this tiny red output prediction of

34
00:02:02,947 --> 00:02:05,340
the solar panel.

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:08,290
This is gonna be the example we will use for

36
00:02:08,290 --> 00:02:09,350
this particular module.

37
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,371
However discussing sequence without using text

38
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,360
data is difficult and both of them go hand to hand.

39
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,351
So here is another motif that we will learn which is called many

40
00:02:20,351 --> 00:02:23,410
to many with one to one correspondence.

41
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:28,490
What I mean here is you'll have many inputs and you'll have

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:31,970
corresponding to those inputs you'll have an output each.

43
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:33,360
So there are many inputs and

44
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,550
many outputs and each having one to one correspondence.

45
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,090
Again, we'll see how to build models around that.

46
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:42,570
In this case we are going to use the tagging

47
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,190
the entities in the air traffic controller

48
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,940
popularly known at the ATIS data set.

49
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,310
So what does ATIS data set entail?

50
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,440
It has a token, and we will generate corresponding label.

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,610
Here is the tokens combined to form sentences.

52
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,680
So the original ATIS data will have a bunch of

53
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,790
words that come together to make a sentence, and

54
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,410
we are going to label them to some meaningful classifications

55
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,340
that will be generated out of this model.

56
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,820
If you're wondering how

57
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:18,850
this word gets converted into a numerical entity,

58
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,760
we will cover that in the subsequent lectures.

59
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:26,870
And here you can see is that burbank is a city, okay?

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,990
And so is seattle.

61
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:33,280
However when we are able to classify these using

62
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,090
history information, which I will describe to you shortly.

63
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,640
You are able to give it a fine grain description of

64
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,640
that this is the from city and this is a to city.
