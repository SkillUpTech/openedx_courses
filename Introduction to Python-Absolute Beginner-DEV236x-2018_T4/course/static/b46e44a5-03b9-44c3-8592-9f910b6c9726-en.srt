00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:05,500
>> Let's look at module one's required coding activity.

1
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,180
And the first thing that you want to know about

2
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,775
it if you're reading through the page,

3
00:00:10,775 --> 00:00:13,340
you'll see the code requirements.

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:16,465
And so those are that you use a variable assignment,

5
00:00:16,465 --> 00:00:18,620
so such as setting a greeting

6
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:21,745
to a string, like a variable.

7
00:00:21,745 --> 00:00:24,300
So I say the variable greeting = "hello",

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,370
that you use an input statement

9
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,520
so that you're going to get that feedback,

10
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,130
and maybe assign that to greeting as well.

11
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:34,605
And then you would use the in keyword.

12
00:00:34,605 --> 00:00:35,720
That's the key to

13
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,765
this entire activity is that we're going to search

14
00:00:38,765 --> 00:00:41,855
a larger string and to see

15
00:00:41,855 --> 00:00:45,505
if specific substrings are contained in there.

16
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:47,390
And to make our match easier to do,

17
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,640
we're going to convert things to all upper or all

18
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,235
lower so that it's not case-sensitive.

19
00:00:53,235 --> 00:00:55,889
Let's run that solution code.

20
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,200
So the first thing

21
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,360
your program should do is prompt people

22
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:02,280
for different categories of

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,310
food they've eaten in the last 24 hours,

24
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,635
so that would be something like you would say,

25
00:01:06,635 --> 00:01:08,375
I might have meat,

26
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:11,760
and I might have dairy,

27
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:19,093
and fruit, and pasta.

28
00:01:19,093 --> 00:01:21,600
And so, you could just go ahead

29
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,450
and just put some different categories in food like that.

30
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,390
And then when you have

31
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:29,865
enough things in there, you'd put enter,

32
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:32,135
and then that gets recorded in as a string,

33
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:33,730
and then you do your string tests,

34
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:38,060
so then it will print out these various messages.

35
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,020
So this one says, "It is true

36
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,710
that dairy is contained in that string",

37
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:47,645
and "It is true that nuts is contained in the string",

38
00:01:47,645 --> 00:01:49,240
and "It is false that

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,780
seafood and chocolate are contained in the string".

40
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,085
So, this is what your code should look like.

41
00:01:55,085 --> 00:01:57,780
Again, let's make sure that we use all of

42
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,940
the required code elements

43
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,695
and we'll submit those into the edX form.

44
00:02:04,695 --> 00:02:10,675
The edX form is not necessarily the most elegant.

45
00:02:10,675 --> 00:02:13,020
And what I mean by that is that you will

46
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,430
not see your code formatted when you paste it in,

47
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:19,530
so I placed some solution code in there and

48
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,480
then we see that it all kind of

49
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,055
looks like one line and that's to be expected.

50
00:02:24,055 --> 00:02:26,880
But then you hit the Submit button and,

51
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,830
I got everything right, so there I go.

52
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,430
If I was missing one of the keywords,

53
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:35,010
then it would say I'm wrong and I would

54
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:37,445
have one more attempt to get that right.

55
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:39,750
So, please check again that you have

56
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,000
all of the keywords. Good luck.
