00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,759
We saw how starts with can help us, find

1
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,969
a search of the first character and a

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,099
string. But sometimes we want to search

3
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:14,960
in the middle of the string and so the

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,480
Boolean_in_keyword is very useful in

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:23,930
this regard. So below, I have a string

6
00:00:23,980 --> 00:00:27,134
called menu and I just entered a number

7
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,350
of things that might be in a menu in that

8
00:00:29,410 --> 00:00:37,760
string and then I just can print and to  the result here of to see, If pizza is

9
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,470
in menu and so, what this will do with

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,979
the in keyword is, Pizza it's gonna be the

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:48,049
search string and they're gonna run

12
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,110
it through this entire list to see if it

13
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,119
gets a match and So the way that our

14
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,610
work is at each letter, it will just

15
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,244
check if there is a P and then when it's

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,720
there it will see the second letter and soon and that doesn't work then we'll

17
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,070
move on to it gets to the start again

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,180
with another piece.

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:08,690
So we can run this and it says False, but

20
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,510
I see that right here there's pizza in

21
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,270
the menu but it wasn't found so the

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,894
problem in this case is that, I need to

23
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:20,540
have pizza be lowercase and so, I can run

24
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:25,490
it with a lowercase p and then I see

25
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,190
that it's true and so this is really a

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,420
great part of Python here is this the

27
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:34,430
way that it works to just use this word

28
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:36,620
and it seems very natural to look for

29
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,020
something like this because, I named my

30
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:41,900
variable menu and my search term was

31
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,830
quite straightforward, I could just run

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,260
this really easily and I couldn't use a

33
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,420
variable in this case as well. So let's

34
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:57,020
look over here at another version of

35
00:01:57,070 --> 00:02:01,430
pizza. In this case, I put lower and lower

36
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,920
and this is really a best practice that

37
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:10,100
you should look for in any  of you search, if you don't care

38
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,800
about case sensitivity, then it's a good

39
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:16,790
practice to make lower used in both

40
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,607
sides and we can see how that makes

41
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:20,649
search run a lot faster .

42
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:25,220
The "in" keyword is very effective in searching within

43
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,610
strings and so the best practice we use

44
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:31,670
with that is when case sensitivity is

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:35,310
not important , we can use a dot lower

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,698
and use that string method to make both the

47
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,950
search string and search target a

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,220
lowercase . And that will lead to really

49
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:52,300
effective searching.
