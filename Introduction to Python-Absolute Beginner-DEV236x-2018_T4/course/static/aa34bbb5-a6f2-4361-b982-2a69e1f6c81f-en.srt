We've worked with some strings printing, and

1
00:00:06,115 --> 00:00:09,396
now let's talk a little bit more what a string is.

2
00:00:09,397 --> 00:00:13,607
So a string, is just a sequence of characters, and so

3
00:00:13,608 --> 00:00:17,140
that just means one or more characters.

4
00:00:17,141 --> 00:00:20,930
And the characters are just the keyboard characters, for

5
00:00:20,931 --> 00:00:22,160
the most part.

6
00:00:22,161 --> 00:00:26,655
So case a through z, lowercase a through z,

7
00:00:26,656 --> 00:00:33,580
as well as the digits 0 through 9, and a variety of punctuation and

8
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:38,816
characters and just any of the symbols that we see.

9
00:00:38,817 --> 00:00:44,048
We can add some more in there, but basically, all of these pieces

10
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:49,013
that we see in our keyboard, those are all valid characters.

11
00:00:49,014 --> 00:00:53,275
And we can also have characters that we'll see later how to do that

12
00:00:53,276 --> 00:00:57,012
are not printable, such as a new line character as well.

13
00:00:57,013 --> 00:01:00,612
And so we can echo that to the screen by running,

14
00:01:00,613 --> 00:01:04,410
because the characters are in our quotes.

15
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:06,720
Just like we did with the print statement earlier,

16
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,880
we could show our string.

17
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:14,140
So, again, the rules are single quotes matching,

18
00:01:14,141 --> 00:01:17,580
so this starts and ends with single quotes and,

19
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:21,950
or double quotes matching, start or end with a double quote.

20
00:01:21,951 --> 00:01:24,210
Just run that, and so that runs nicely.

21
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:28,350
If we don't match our quotes, we can see how that looks,

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,400
so it tells us we have a SyntaxError.

23
00:01:32,401 --> 00:01:36,850
And that's just telling us that we have not used

24
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:41,540
proper Python formatting on the way that we use a string.

25
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:46,110
And so, because it starts with a double quote and

26
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:48,450
ends with a single quote, we have to match those.

27
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:52,100
I could either make them both single or both double.

28
00:01:52,101 --> 00:01:55,830
And then I will make them both double, maybe not with so

29
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:57,180
many returns.

30
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,220
And then that will work right there.

31
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,150
So we see, in working with strings, that they

32
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:11,970
are a sequence of characters, so one or more character.

33
00:02:11,971 --> 00:02:16,870
And that the characters have to be in matching quotes, double quotes or

34
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:17,780
single quotes.
