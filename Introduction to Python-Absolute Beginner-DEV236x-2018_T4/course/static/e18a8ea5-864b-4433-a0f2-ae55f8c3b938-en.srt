We know Strings come in quotes.

1
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:10,000
But what do you do, when you need to display a quote in a string?

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,490
It could be a problem

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:15,270
because you end the string. So let's take a look at

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,040
using Strings with quotes in quotes.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,670
So, what does it mean to have quotes in quotes?

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:21,930
Well, you know when we

7
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,120
use a string quote, we can use either

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:26,200
a double quote or a single quote.

9
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,000
In this case, I'm using double quotes to enclose my string here,

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,110
but because I'm using double quotes,

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:36,490
I'm allowed to use single quotes inside.

12
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,580
So anytime that I need to display

13
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,670
a single quote, I have to use double quotes for my outer string

14
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:47,730
and then this becomes a character.

15
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,530
So, go ahead and run that, and we see that works fine

16
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:55,640
and then there is my single quote.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:00,490
Now, we just do the reverse, if we want to show a double quote.

18
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:03,270
So, here I have the teacher

19
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:06,180
making a announcement and so we need to

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,730
put that into double quotes and display those.

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:13,690
So, I have single quotes, around the end

22
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,040
and these double quotes inside.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:22,430
They just become characters. So, now I see the--

24
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,780
double quotes show. So it has been a problem

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,420
previously to show quotes,

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:31,400
and now you have the ability to do it.

27
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,560
You can't show double and single quotes

28
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:35,580
in the same sentence yet,

29
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:38,380
but we're still making progress there.
