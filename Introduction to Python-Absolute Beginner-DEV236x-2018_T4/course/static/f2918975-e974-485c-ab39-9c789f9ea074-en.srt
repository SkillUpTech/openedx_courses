00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:06,439
The addition operator, when used with variables,

1
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:10,605
is powerful because we can update and initialize new variables.

2
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:11,105
Let's take a look.

3
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:21,009
So, I'm going to assign add_two the sum of the two integers,

4
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:25,378
and we can run that and print the result.

5
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:31,444
And we can see 34+16 is 50, and we can change numbers or

6
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:36,390
add additional integers, and that still runs.

7
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:42,054
And so now I have a variable, add_two, which contains the sum, 70.

8
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:46,137
I can also use the string concatenation.

9
00:00:46,138 --> 00:00:51,220
And I can have a first name in a variable as Alton.

10
00:00:51,221 --> 00:00:55,830
And then I could have a new variable, greeting, which uses this

11
00:00:55,831 --> 00:01:01,540
variable, Alton, and with a literal string, Happy Birthday.

12
00:01:01,541 --> 00:01:04,530
So let's see what the print(greeting) looks like.

13
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:05,457
And that worked well.

14
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:08,986
So it's just the same as if in this spot I just put in Alton.

15
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:17,100
And then I can further build on that variable.

16
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:21,841
So, greeting, which was created by combining first_name and

17
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:23,520
this literal string.

18
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:27,810
And then I can add another literal string to that.

19
00:01:27,811 --> 00:01:30,690
And I can say, here'ss the greeting_today, and I say,

20
00:01:30,691 --> 00:01:33,130
today is the day, on to the end of that, and

21
00:01:33,131 --> 00:01:35,870
we can run that and print that string.

22
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,494
Happy Birthday Alton, today is the day!

23
00:01:37,495 --> 00:01:44,388
If I go back And I change to the first_name.

24
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,653
Now it's a Happy Birthday Colette.

25
00:01:55,592 --> 00:01:57,630
And today is the day.

26
00:01:57,631 --> 00:02:01,180
So, variables help us reuse the code.

27
00:02:01,181 --> 00:02:04,483
And we can use the string concatenation

28
00:02:04,484 --> 00:02:09,085
to build sentences that will be used in our programs and

29
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:12,870
inject the different variables in there.

30
00:02:12,871 --> 00:02:15,964
So we had all these different opportunities to update

31
00:02:15,965 --> 00:02:16,932
the variables.

32
00:02:20,215 --> 00:02:24,562
Here's another example going back to the first, where we had add_two and

33
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:26,287
we saw 34 and 16 was 50.

34
00:02:26,288 --> 00:02:31,930
And then I'm gonna reuse the add_two and combine it to itself and

35
00:02:31,931 --> 00:02:37,085
assign that to add_four, so lets look at that.

36
00:02:37,086 --> 00:02:39,625
Swell, so, again, this is an example,

37
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:42,745
same as the above with the strings but now with the integers.

38
00:02:44,135 --> 00:02:47,205
Use the addition operator to initialize and

39
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:48,385
update your variables.
