Welcome to module four.

1
00:00:02,992 --> 00:00:09,264
This is probably one of the key modules where you learn

2
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:12,176
a lot about Convolution models,

3
00:00:12,256 --> 00:00:18,160
there are also called Convolution Neural Nets, CNN's, Conv Nets.

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,256
Convolution Neural Nets have been

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,330
bringing a huge amount of

6
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:27,072
revolutionary changes in the domain of deep learning.

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,416
It's been used for image tagging,

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:35,568
face recognition, different kinds of object tracking will look into

9
00:00:35,616 --> 00:00:40,768
these different applications. However, in this module you will learn

10
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:45,760
variety of basic concepts that will enable you to build

11
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,936
very advanced models with practical applications.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,288
So in this module we will continue to use

13
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:56,208
the optical character recognition application as our

14
00:00:56,272 --> 00:01:00,320
foundational problem set to get your hands dirty with building

15
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,816
Convolution models, we will use the MNIST data set.

16
00:01:04,912 --> 00:01:08,816
You will do a brief recap of

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,248
what Multi-Layer Perceptrons are

18
00:01:11,328 --> 00:01:14,600
from our previous module? Then we'll talk about

19
00:01:14,688 --> 00:01:18,030
Convolution Networks and then you will

20
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:21,856
see some popular deep Convolutional Networks.

21
00:01:21,904 --> 00:01:24,420
The concepts that will be

22
00:01:24,528 --> 00:01:26,820
introduced in this model are Convolution

23
00:01:26,896 --> 00:01:31,290
and pooling and then finally you'll see

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,710
we'll walk you through the entire

25
00:01:33,776 --> 00:01:37,070
Workflow of train-test-predict as usual

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,540
where we piece together this concepts

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:43,013
and the network architecture to solve

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:47,226
the problem of OCR using MNIST data.

29
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,693
And hopefully at the end of the module

30
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:51,750
you'll see that we are able to get

31
00:01:51,824 --> 00:01:55,840
better performance out of it, after all that's one of the motivation to build

32
00:01:55,904 --> 00:01:58,624
this modules which enable you to recognize

33
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:04,064
data with spatial coherence or spatial information to do it with very

34
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:08,706
high accuracy almost are better than even human abilities

35
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,493
to perform these tasks.
