A brief recap of what we did in logistic regression.

1
00:00:04,456 --> 00:00:07,125
In logistic regression,

2
00:00:07,125 --> 00:00:11,613
we took the image of the handwritten digit,

3
00:00:11,613 --> 00:00:17,316
flattened it out and then built individual classifiers

4
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:22,666
like ten of those tuned to detect each of the digits.

5
00:00:24,650 --> 00:00:29,554
We did it in one go using a matrix that we learned of

6
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:34,470
the weights here and the corresponding biases.

7
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,718
The output of the model was passed through,

8
00:00:39,718 --> 00:00:43,306
initially we trained with a sigmoid function,

9
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:46,820
which is also called an activation function.

10
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:50,320
And then we also tried with another one which

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,110
is the soft max.

12
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:55,340
Now the soft max one works really well,

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,470
especially with categorical data.

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:59,500
And we use that most often.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:03,359
However, there is a role for these activation functions in

16
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,300
building higher-order models where we layer

17
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,440
one layer of these neurons on top of the other.

18
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:16,140
So, now why do you want to do logistic regression was very,

19
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,550
very clear.

20
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:19,830
And we were able to train a model.

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:22,640
However, if you did your assignment, and

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,800
you trained a logistic regression model,

23
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:30,310
you can use the MNIST data and see what accuracies you get.

24
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:35,243
You probably would get something like 7 to 8% error rate,

25
00:01:35,243 --> 00:01:37,570
or 92 to 93% accuracy.

26
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,950
Which means if you've got 100 digits,

27
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,640
you would see about 7 or 8 of them being misclassified.

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,140
Is that good?

29
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:53,350
Well, if you are writing 100 digits on your post offices

30
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:57,610
using this logistic regression model to classify that

31
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,560
automatically, there's gonna be a large number

32
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,030
of letters that are gonna be delivered in the wrong place.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,147
Let's see how we can fix or

34
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:12,647
update our model that would reduce the error rate.
