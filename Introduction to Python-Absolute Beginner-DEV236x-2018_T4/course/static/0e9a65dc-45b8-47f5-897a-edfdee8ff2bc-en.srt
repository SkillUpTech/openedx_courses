00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:04,417
Before we go too far down the lane, understanding what

1
00:00:04,417 --> 00:00:08,327
convolution operations specifically does, let's take

2
00:00:08,327 --> 00:00:11,528
a moment and understand the image data format.

3
00:00:14,319 --> 00:00:18,805
We have been dealing with the MNIST data, in the previous

4
00:00:18,805 --> 00:00:22,644
modules we have been flattening it out into array

5
00:00:24,867 --> 00:00:28,689
And here I hopefully have convinced you that,

6
00:00:28,689 --> 00:00:33,394
that is not really ideal because we lose the correlations

7
00:00:33,394 --> 00:00:38,403
between the pixels that exist here, when we flatten it out.

8
00:00:40,806 --> 00:00:45,138
So we would be treating from hereon, this image

9
00:00:47,177 --> 00:00:51,110
As a matrix with one channel.

10
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:53,829
Because this is a grayscale image,

11
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:59,067
it has only shades of gray and, With parameters,

12
00:00:59,067 --> 00:01:02,339
weight and height, in this case, these are both 28.

13
00:01:04,388 --> 00:01:09,993
So, they are 28 x 28 pixels, and each pixel has 1 integer value.

14
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:15,452
Another set of images that you'll often encounter, and

15
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:17,343
this is more likely to be the case,

16
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:19,640
where you'll see natural scene images.

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,398
And here, your matrix dimensions are gonna be the same weight and

18
00:01:25,398 --> 00:01:29,871
height, so this is the weight, and that's gonna be the height.

19
00:01:31,066 --> 00:01:33,960
But, there are three channels.

20
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,680
The red, green, and blue channels.

21
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,216
How do these channels come together to form this nice

22
00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:43,513
beautiful image of the fire truck.

23
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:45,890
Let's take a look at it.

24
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:49,995
Here is a moniker for the three channels.

25
00:01:49,995 --> 00:01:54,952
Here you can see, this is the red channel, and

26
00:01:54,952 --> 00:01:59,909
the red parts of the fire truck are now bright,

27
00:01:59,909 --> 00:02:02,726
very bright here, okay?

28
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:10,000
And green parts, which are predominantly

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,165
the grass area, is very bright here.

30
00:02:15,627 --> 00:02:20,424
And here, the sky, which is largely blue,

31
00:02:20,424 --> 00:02:23,050
is very, very bright.

32
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,531
So these three channels come together to form this image.
