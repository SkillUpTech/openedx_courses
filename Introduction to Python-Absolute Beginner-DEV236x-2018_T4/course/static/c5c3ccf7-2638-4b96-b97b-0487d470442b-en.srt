Here are some tips in solving the Bird Available problem.

1
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:10,637
To make this task easier to understand,

2
00:00:10,638 --> 00:00:13,817
let's just run a sample of the completed program.

3
00:00:13,818 --> 00:00:17,319
So, we see that we need to create a label that ask for

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,018
input about the type of bird to search.

5
00:00:22,218 --> 00:00:25,675
I entered chicken, because chicken is not on the list of

6
00:00:25,676 --> 00:00:28,260
the available bird types in this string.

7
00:00:28,261 --> 00:00:31,200
So let's go ahead and enter that and

8
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:34,538
we see that chicken available is false.

9
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:36,578
So you should test something like that,

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,458
that is not in the list to make sure that it works as false.

11
00:00:41,398 --> 00:00:45,428
Now, let's look for something that is in the string, and so

12
00:00:45,429 --> 00:00:46,938
I'm gonna type crow.

13
00:00:50,518 --> 00:00:53,198
And crow available is true, so we know that works.

14
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,255
What would happen, though, if I were to type crow so

15
00:00:56,256 --> 00:00:57,718
it was not the same case?

16
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:06,018
So I capitalize crow, and it's still found.

17
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:09,855
So that means, when we're doing our comparison for the string from

18
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:13,622
the input, that we're gonna have to do something to make sure that

19
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:17,410
the cases don't really matter when we're doing the comparison.
