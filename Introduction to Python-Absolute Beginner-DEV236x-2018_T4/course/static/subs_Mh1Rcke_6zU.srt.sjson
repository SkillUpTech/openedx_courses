    "Previously we ran into some type errors", 
    "when we try to concatenate strings", 
    "and numbers inside a print statements.", 
    "And we're going to see how we can fix that", 
    "using the comma format and it allows us to combine them easily.", 
    "So this is the old way that we would try", 
    "to combine these elements using the", 
    "addition and we know that we can't add", 
    "the strings and the numbers together and so,", 
    "we get that type error and so the way", 
    "that we can fix that is you could create", 
    "a string out of the number", 
    "or we could use a comma.", 
    "So this is a great improvement is now,", 
    "I'm allowed to legally combine a number", 
    "and a string in the same print statement.", 
    "So let's look below with a number variable.", 
    "So I have num error equals zero", 
    "and then I have this longish print statement", 
    "separated with commas using", 
    "the comma formatting and I have a string", 
    "int equals and then I have a literal number,", 
    "and then I have a literal string,", 
    "and then I have this number here as well", 
    "that is the variable number error which", 
    "would be zero and then followed with a string.", 
    "So I can alternate strings and numbers", 
    "or I can do variable numbers", 
    "and hard-coded numbers and let's see how that runs.", 
    "And so that works, my 14 shows up fine", 
    "and my number of zero errors came up", 
    "and indeed we got zero errors in that.", 
    "So in this lesson, we learned that we can", 
    "combine numbers with strings using", 
    "the comma print formatting and then that can", 
    "really speed up our display of information."
