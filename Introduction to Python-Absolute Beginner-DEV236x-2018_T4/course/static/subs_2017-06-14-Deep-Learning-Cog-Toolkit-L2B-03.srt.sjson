    "the reader, next mini batch to get our 25 samples using the map",

    "So, we'll take our data sub-label and our", 
    "data sub input and put them into", 
    "a variable called image label and image data,",

    "at that point. So, if you remember from up here, we created",

    "and so the top label here-- the top row", 
    "is the actual labels and the bottom rows", 
    "are our predictions. So let's see how", 
    "we did. 6, 7, this list entry is wrong,", 
    "this entry is wrong, right, right, right, right, right, wrong, OK.", 
    "So it's a mixture of right/wrong.", 
    "Let's try and visualize one of the images", 
    "and its label, so we'll pick sample number 5,", 
    "and we will use matplotlib, to image show to plot that", 
    "from my image data sample number,", 
    "reshape is 28 by 28 again and use a gray map,", 
    "and then we'll print out a", 
    "the actual predicted label from a gt label sample number,", 
    "and it's actually coming from prediction sample number,", 
    "and long behold it looks like a 9", 
    "and we predicted an 8. So, that's OK.", 
    "That we know our model isn't perfect yet,", 
    "but that's sort of a way of checking and making sure that things work", 
    "like we expect they would at the detail level", 
    "and that's also an example of--", 
    "the kind of code we would need to do predictions in a deployed model.", 
    "OK, so that's it for our coverage of the notebook.", 
    "It's time for you now to go to the notebook", 
    "yourself, open it up, run it, try changing some things,", 
    "try printing out some values,", 
    "intermediate values and make sure", 
    "you understand what's going on and I also suggest that", 
    "you try some of the", 
    "suggested exercises listed at the bottom", 
    "or maybe there's some throughout the notebook.",
