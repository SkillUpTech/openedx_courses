    "So now you know, how we can build classifiers, and", 
    "we build ten of those to be able to detect a hand written",

    "meaning zero to nine.", 
    "Here, what it means is that for the digit 3,", 
    "you get a very high value and rest of it are relatively low.", 
    "However, I would like to give it a probabilistic interpretation.", 
    "And compare one digit with other and", 
    "in this case if you see it, that is", 
    "not possible because all these digits do not sum up to one.", 
    "One of the key requirements for", 
    "us to give it a probabilistic interpretation.", 
    "So, in machine learning and", 
    "in deep neutral especially, we use logistic regression", 
    "with something we call Softmax which I'll explain shortly.", 
    "And this has much better distributional properties.", 
    "And statistically it yields better results", 
    "when you train models with Softmax as the output layer.", 
    "So typically what happens is, instead of a sigmoid function", 
    "that we had here before, we do not have anything.", 
    "It's a pass through and this becomes our model function.", 
    "And the output can be any value from z0 to z9.", 
    "What we do then is, normalize these z", 
    "scores by first exponentiating them and", 
    "then dividing it by the sum of those exponents.", 
    "And this yields a vector which is indicative", 
    "of the predicted probabilities of a digit 3,", 
    "indeed being detected as the digit 3.", 
    "When you have trained the model parameters, Ws and Bs,", 
    "they should have a very high value and", 
    "the others would have a much lower value.", 
    "And now you can compare one against the other.", 
    "So this is called the logistic regression with Softmax."
