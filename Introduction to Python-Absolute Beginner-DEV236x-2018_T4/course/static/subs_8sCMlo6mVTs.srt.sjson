    "model capacity is important to better understand what it", 
    "takes to encapsulate the knowledge that comes from", 
    "combining inputs with the corresponding history.", 
    "It's also important to recognize what the data is and what", 
    "the format would look like and how to feed it into the model.", 
    "So let's take a closer look at the ATIS data.", 
    "This data comes from human computer queries from", 
    "Air Travel Information Services.", 
    "There are 943 unique words,", 
    "we'll also refer to that as the vocabulary.", 
    "So when I said show flight from Burbank to Seattle on a day,", 
    "each of those words would be word in this vocabulary.", 
    "So there are 943 of those.", 
    "And the corresponding labels such as the other from city",

    "There are 26 intent tags in the data set.", 
    "We will not be using that in this tutorial,", 
    "we'll just be using the first two as the input, and", 
    "this is the corresponding label for the output.", 
    "Now, let's take a look at what one of that sentence might", 
    "look like.", 
    "We always start with this tag called beginning of sentence.", 
    "And then the real query,",

    "This token beginning of sentence is the 178th",

    "Thursday is depart_date.day_name and next week",

    "of the corresponding word in the vocabulary,", 
    "there are total of 943 words.", 
    "And corresponding to those words, this number which is", 
    "###:1, again indicates one of these numbers here which", 
    "would be the location or the index of that particular", 
    "labelled in the label set of vocabulary if you might say.",
