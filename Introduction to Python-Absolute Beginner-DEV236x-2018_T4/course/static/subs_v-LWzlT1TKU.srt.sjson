    "and simplify things a little bit.", 
    "Previously we used a message", 
    "to the user in a print statement and then we put in our input.",

    "this message up here  and then below, I have to",

    "I can just do it all on a single line.", 
    "So, inside of the parenthesis,  I'm allowed to", 
    "put in a message, in a string.", 
    "And so that will be displayed to the user", 
    "and we're going to see right here", 
    "that if I run that now,  the prompt message", 
    "that is inside the parenthesis  of the input function", 
    "is displayed and then I can", 
    "enter a name in there.", 
    "And now, that is assigned to student name",

    "what kind of type that is.", 
    "And we see that, that is a type string.", 
    "So, that is a string because it's a name",

    "But let's look back at our initial example", 
    "here with small int. What is that?", 
    "Well it's also a string.", 
    "So, no matter what your intent is  whether you want", 
    "this to be a numeric value or a string value,", 
    "it's always going to be a string.",

    "the same as 3 in quotes.", 
    "This is rather than the numeric 3. So we would not", 
    "be able to add together three plus three.", 
    "So, what we've learned is that, we can use", 
    "the input prompt that's built into the", 
    "input statement by typing inside the", 
    "parenthesis and that no matter what", 
    "no matter what we type in", 
    "to the input statement is always going to be a string."
