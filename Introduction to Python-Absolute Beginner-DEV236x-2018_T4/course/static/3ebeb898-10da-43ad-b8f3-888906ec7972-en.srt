0
00:00:03,228 --> 00:00:05,274
deep learning let's take a step and

1
00:00:05,274 --> 00:00:08,282
understand what you can expect later in the course.

2
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:14,220
So we'll cover the deep learning basics in six modules.

3
00:00:15,248 --> 00:00:19,410
In Module 1, you'll have a flavor of the different concepts

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,420
getting introduced in the form of different application where

5
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:27,320
deep learning is being used, and a high level modeling work

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,960
flow that we will be using throughout the later modules.

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:34,603
In Module 2, we will cover logistic regression with

8
00:00:34,603 --> 00:00:37,110
an application in optical character recognition.

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,790
We will use the optical character recognition

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,350
application in module three and four as well.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,071
In Module 3, we will use Multi-layer perceptron

12
00:00:49,071 --> 00:00:51,497
base models for the task.

13
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:54,577
And in Module 4, we will use convolution network for

14
00:00:54,577 --> 00:00:57,320
the same optical character recognition task.

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,700
In Module 5, we will introduce time-series

16
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,219
modeling using deep networks.

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:09,150
In Module 6, we will going to text modeling,

18
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:12,940
we'll specifically use long-short term memory

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,660
recurrence units for text classification.

20
00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:22,420
The course will have 5 hands-on lab, and 5 quizzes.

21
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,160
These are required for certification.

22
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,407
We will use Python Jupyter notebooks for your hands-on lab.

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,510
Upon completion, the students will be having enough knowledge

24
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,910
to build their own deep learning, end to end workflow,

25
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:42,240
combining the concepts, and the algorithms,

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,909
that will be introduced in this course.

27
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,686
You'll be specifically be able to build these models and

28
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:52,834
combining the end to end workflow that will get

29
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:57,113
introduced, you should be able solve practical problems in AI

30
00:01:57,113 --> 00:01:59,634
with large amount of data involved.

31
00:02:03,668 --> 00:02:07,455
So who are the audience for this course?

32
00:02:07,455 --> 00:02:10,433
We aim this course for Data Scientists and

33
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:14,519
Engineers who are getting introduced to deep learning,

34
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:17,923
who have some background in machine learning,

35
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:20,984
and want to try out what deep learning can or

36
00:02:20,984 --> 00:02:24,419
cannot provide in their application domains.

37
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:30,597
So this course is more of a practical hands on approach.

38
00:02:30,597 --> 00:02:33,573
We also target technical managers who are interested and

39
00:02:33,573 --> 00:02:36,310
involved in development in AI based technologies.

40
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,580
The third audience are the machine learning scientists

41
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,510
who are looking to build deep models, and

42
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:48,490
the focus is gonna be on agility and ease.

43
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,229
This is very, very important because as you can imagine,

44
00:02:52,229 --> 00:02:54,898
with large amount of data involved, it is

45
00:02:54,898 --> 00:02:58,968
important that you are able to scale your models efficiently.

46
00:03:01,747 --> 00:03:04,439
So let's talk a little bit about the instructors.

47
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:10,363
I am Sayan Pathak I'm a principal machine learning

48
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:12,420
scientist at Microsoft.

49
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,616
I've built several machine learning applications in my past

50
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:19,123
in healthcare domain funded by NIH.

51
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:21,904
I have published in neuroinformatics during my

52
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:24,830
tenure at the Allen Institute for Brain Science.

53
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,160
I have a diverse range of interests starting from

54
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,230
computer vision, healthcare, informatics

55
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:38,140
applied to social networks as well as online advertisements.

56
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,880
I have academic affiliations with the University of

57
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,690
Washington and at the Indian Institute of Technology.

58
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,117
I'm also an instructor at the Ai school at Microsoft.

59
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:54,051
And my co-instructor, Roland Fernandez,

60
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:56,790
he's a researcher at Microsoft.

61
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:59,090
He's also an Ai school instructor.

62
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,470
His interested are in reinforcement learning,

63
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:05,260
autonomous multitask learning, and Computer Human Interaction.

64
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:10,800
He has worked in areas of Natural User Interface, activity

65
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,980
based computing, and a large number of programmer tools,

66
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,530
operating systems, and databases.

67
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:20,170
Let's talk a little bit about programming environment.

68
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,619
We'll be using Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK).

69
00:04:26,619 --> 00:04:28,920
We will be using different environments for

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,730
this course that meets your need.

71
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,480
Any one of them is appropriate for

72
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,020
you to successfully complete this course.

73
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,987
The first one that is recommended is that you install

74
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:44,364
the toolkit locally on a machine that you have.

75
00:04:44,364 --> 00:04:47,751
You can also use pre-installed notebooks in

76
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:49,450
the Azure Notebooks.

77
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,090
Note these are gonna be CPU only.

78
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:56,892
So for those of you who want to leverage the powers

79
00:04:56,892 --> 00:05:01,475
of deep learning, we do recommend using GPU.

80
00:05:01,475 --> 00:05:05,449
But for the course, you can use CPU machines only and

81
00:05:05,449 --> 00:05:08,260
successfully complete the course.

82
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:11,298
Additionally, we do provide access to Azure Data Science

83
00:05:11,298 --> 00:05:14,584
Virtual Machines, where you can sign up with a trial account.

84
00:05:14,584 --> 00:05:18,796
More details will be provided to you in the form of course notes,

85
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:22,073
samples, and in the supplementary material that

86
00:05:22,073 --> 00:05:24,115
comes along with this course.
