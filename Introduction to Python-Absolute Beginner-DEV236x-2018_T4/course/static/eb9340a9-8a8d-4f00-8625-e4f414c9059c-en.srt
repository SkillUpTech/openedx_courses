00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,362
We'll start with explaining what the data looks like a bit later,

1
00:00:07,362 --> 00:00:12,804
but first let's get the intuition of the task involved

2
00:00:12,804 --> 00:00:18,853
in tagging entities in the Air Traffic Controller Data Set.

3
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:25,100
We have Text tokens which we would associate class labels.

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:31,950
Each token would have a corresponding class labels and

5
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:36,750
we have a notion of recurrence here because a sentence or

6
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:40,670
a sequence would have multiple tokens associated with it.

7
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,540
For instance, we can start with

8
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:48,323
the first token here in one of the sequences show, and

9
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:52,800
the label that we will assign to it is O, or other.

10
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:56,289
And once you process that, we'll also have a history.

11
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:59,594
Remember, there is no history when we start the recurring

12
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:01,490
pattern, that history is zero.

13
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:06,803
So, the next token would be say, Burbank,

14
00:01:06,803 --> 00:01:10,942
and the corresponding label would be From_city.

15
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:15,681
The following one is to, and this one we will label other,

16
00:01:15,681 --> 00:01:19,885
and so and so forth, the next token being Seattle.

17
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:24,749
So now the fact that there was to, the word to that appeared

18
00:01:24,749 --> 00:01:29,925
before a name of a city, renders it with a different context.

19
00:01:29,925 --> 00:01:33,372
In this case we label it as a To_city, and

20
00:01:33,372 --> 00:01:35,447
then flights tomorrow.

21
00:01:35,447 --> 00:01:40,153
So think about an application where you have a sentence or

22
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:42,995
a query that a user makes on an app,

23
00:01:42,995 --> 00:01:46,932
say show Burbank to Seattle flights tomorrow.

24
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:51,287
You can immediately feed it into some kind of a structured

25
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:56,279
context, which is the beginning of the location where the person

26
00:01:56,279 --> 00:02:00,000
is gonna start flying, and it's destination,

27
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,628
with the date that is going to be associated with the intended

28
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:08,653
action of finding a flight for that particular day.

29
00:02:08,653 --> 00:02:11,490
So here you can see there are many inputs.

30
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,620
And there are correspondingly as many tokens associated with it.
