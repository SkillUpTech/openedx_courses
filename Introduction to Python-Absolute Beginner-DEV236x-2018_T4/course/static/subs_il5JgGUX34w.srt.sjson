    "Hopefully from the previous video you have", 
    "now understood the value of incorporating history", 
    "in making better predictions in the future.", 
    "In this section we will walk you through how that", 
    "history can be incorporated in the framework of recurrence.", 
    "So let's see.", 
    "You have an input, which goes into your model.", 
    "And this input could be as simple as the temperature", 
    "of the given day.", 
    "However, we have convinced ourselves here that adding some", 
    "extra input from the past can really help us", 
    "make better predictions.", 
    "For instance,", 
    "the output of the solar panel from our previous day.", 
    "Or, any other previous day's temperatures, etc, etc.", 
    "So, that's why you see this vector on top of foot notation", 
    "which means that the input can be a set of numbers.", 
    "And corresponding to that you would have n-dimensional", 
    "array here.", 
    "Now I'm going to point out to the dimensionality of the array", 
    "over and over as we go along.", 
    "Because it's key to understand the data that you're gonna use", 
    "to build this recurrent networks and how the dimensionality of", 
    "the data interplays with the predictions you're gonna make.", 
    "Now what's the output gonna look like?", 
    "So the output in our case was the output of a single day for", 
    "that solar panel.", 
    "So it was a single output, say W out and", 
    "that corresponds to the wattage.", 
    "Now it could be that we are gonna be outputting.", 
    "The wattage of the solar panel for multiple days in future,", 
    "so Wout + 1, say five days or so, you could do that.", 
    "So y can also be a vector.", 
    "In this case y is a c-dimensional array.", 
    "Now, what is missing?", 
    "We have incorporated multiple features.", 
    "And we figured out", 
    "a way to predict multiple things in to the future.", 
    "I hope you remember in the previous video we talked", 
    "about history.", 
    "How can we incorporate history into our modeling framework?", 
    "Let's see.", 
    "So what we do in neural networks is that we have this", 
    "thing called the internal state which is n-dimensional array.", 
    "This is also known as the history.", 
    "For every time we make a prediction y,", 
    "we also made a history.", 
    "Obviously in the first round the history is zero.", 
    "There is no history, but", 
    "subsequently you will have a notion of history", 
    "that feeds into the next stage of your model.", 
    "So here, you'll take the history from t = 1,", 
    "take the next set of inputs.", 
    "And emit the corresponding outputs and", 
    "additionally they'll also emit the updated history.", 
    "So note that history keeps getting updated", 
    "as we go from one time point to the other, okay?", 
    "Now the inputs could be an array of numeric values", 
    "from different sensors, like you have seen here.", 
    "It could be an image.", 
    "Pixels in an array.", 
    "Here we would map the image pixels to a compact", 
    "representation say n values.", 
    "You know the ways to do that given the conclusion models you", 
    "have that you have built, and from words in text.", 
    "So you haven't quite done this yet.", 
    "By the end of next module you'll know how to do this.", 
    "But I'm just giving a heads up and a teaser that we can", 
    "represent words as a numeric factor, and using something", 
    "called embeddings that you'll learn in the next module.", 
    "So, this is how our recurrent network is going to look like.", 
    "You'll have an input, you'll have an output, and", 
    "you will have an internal state.", 
    "Or history,", 
    "which we'll keep updating at every stage of recursion.", 
    "So, that recursion at each stage implies that there is", 
    "a notion of time, and you'll hear the time steps and", 
    "recursion being used interchangeably.", 
    "And here is a visual of what that input vector would", 
    "look like, this could be different entities", 
    "all encoded in a numeric array and outputs.", 
    "C dimension, there's gonna be N dimension, and", 
    "H is gonna be m dimensions"
