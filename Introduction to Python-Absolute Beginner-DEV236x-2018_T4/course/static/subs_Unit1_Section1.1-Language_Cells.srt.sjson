    "Common tasks in using the Jupyter Notebook are to set the programming",

    "we always want our notebook in a Python 3 state.", 
    "Sometimes they can be in a different version of Python,", 
    "such as Python 2 and we see right there that I have it in Python 2.", 
    "And what I did to change that is the same thing we're gonna do to get in", 
    "into Python 3, which is go to the kernel tab,", 
    "which is the operating system that runs this Jupyter notebook.", 
    "Hit Change kernel, and then choose Python 3.", 
    "Another common issue with a Jupyter notebook is you might write", 
    "some code and it puts the notebook in an unstable state.", 
    "Either the browser will become frozen or", 
    "the code just is running too long and will not finish.", 
    "So we reset the kernel, so again we're gonna go to the Kernel menu up", 
    "there, and we're gonna either hit Restart or", 
    "often you're gonna hit Restart and Clear Output.", 
    "And what Clear Output will do is put all of the previously",

    "The last item we saw previously is inserting new cells.", 
    "So, to insert a new cell we know that we can", 
    "push both Shift + Enter at the same time.", 
    "If it is the last cell, it will add a cell at the bottom, but", 
    "if you're in a middle cell, if you hit Shift+Enter,", 
    "it just runs the cell and then moves to the next cell.",

    "I have z with a variable over there and I go,", 
    "I forgot y and so, I wanna insert a cell.", 
    "Well there is the Insert menu and I can insert a cell above or below.", 
    "In this case, I'll do below and", 
    "then I can put my y value in there and I can insert a cell.", 
    "So we saw we can change the programming language", 
    "from the Kernel tab.", 
    "With Change kernel, we can also restart and restart and", 
    "clear all the output using the Kernel tab and we can insert", 
    "new cells using the Insert menu and insert either above or below."
