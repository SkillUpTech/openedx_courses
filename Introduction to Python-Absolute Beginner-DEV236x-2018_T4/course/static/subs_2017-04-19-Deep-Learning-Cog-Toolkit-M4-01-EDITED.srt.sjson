    "Welcome to module four.", 
    "This is probably one of the key modules where you learn", 
    "a lot about Convolution models,", 
    "there are also called Convolution Neural Nets, CNN's, Conv Nets.", 
    "Convolution Neural Nets have been", 
    "bringing a huge amount of", 
    "revolutionary changes in the domain of deep learning.", 
    "It's been used for image tagging,", 
    "face recognition, different kinds of object tracking will look into", 
    "these different applications. However, in this module you will learn", 
    "variety of basic concepts that will enable you to build", 
    "very advanced models with practical applications.", 
    "So in this module we will continue to use", 
    "the optical character recognition application as our", 
    "foundational problem set to get your hands dirty with building", 
    "Convolution models, we will use the MNIST data set.", 
    "You will do a brief recap of", 
    "what Multi-Layer Perceptrons are", 
    "from our previous module? Then we'll talk about", 
    "Convolution Networks and then you will", 
    "see some popular deep Convolutional Networks.", 
    "The concepts that will be", 
    "introduced in this model are Convolution", 
    "and pooling and then finally you'll see", 
    "we'll walk you through the entire", 
    "Workflow of train-test-predict as usual", 
    "where we piece together this concepts", 
    "and the network architecture to solve", 
    "the problem of OCR using MNIST data.", 
    "And hopefully at the end of the module", 
    "you'll see that we are able to get", 
    "better performance out of it, after all that's one of the motivation to build", 
    "this modules which enable you to recognize", 
    "data with spatial coherence or spatial information to do it with very", 
    "high accuracy almost are better than even human abilities", 
    "to perform these tasks."
