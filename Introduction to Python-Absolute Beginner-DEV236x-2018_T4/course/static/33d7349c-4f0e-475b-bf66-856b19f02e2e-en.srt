00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,060
Casting input is a common task.

1
00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:11,160
Input always is a string and so it's important sometimes that we are able

2
00:00:11,161 --> 00:00:15,850
to change it into a float, or an integer, or back to a string.

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:20,535
>> Casting is when we force a type upon an object.

4
00:00:20,536 --> 00:00:23,850
We're gonna look at three different types of casts.

5
00:00:23,851 --> 00:00:27,185
Int, forces something to become an integer,

6
00:00:27,186 --> 00:00:31,940
str is a string cast, and then float.

7
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:34,720
Let's look at this example where we have two weights.

8
00:00:34,721 --> 00:00:37,090
One is a string, and the second one is an integer.

9
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,310
When we add numbers, they can be floats and integers but not strings.

10
00:00:43,311 --> 00:00:47,850
In this case, if we run the code, we get the familiar TypeError that we

11
00:00:47,851 --> 00:00:50,670
saw earlier when we did string concatenation and

12
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:54,300
try to add an integer to a string.

13
00:00:54,301 --> 00:00:57,837
It's the same error, here, we'll need weight1, the string,

14
00:00:57,838 --> 00:00:59,046
to become an integer.

15
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:10,986
Cast it by typing the keyword int in front of the object and

16
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,064
place it in parenthesis.

17
00:01:16,067 --> 00:01:23,410
Now, 60 changes from digits that are string to numbers.

18
00:01:23,411 --> 00:01:25,146
And we add and get our result 230.

19
00:01:25,147 --> 00:01:30,348
In this example, we're going to calculate

20
00:01:30,349 --> 00:01:34,700
the graduation age of a student.

21
00:01:34,701 --> 00:01:36,680
First, let's get some input.

22
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,380
Age of the new student.

23
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:40,270
Input is always a string.

24
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,416
So I'm going to take that string input and

25
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:51,010
add it to 3.75 to calculate the graduation age.

26
00:01:51,011 --> 00:01:57,860
But I'll need the age of the new student to be a float value,

27
00:01:57,861 --> 00:02:02,810
so in order to cast that to a float in parenthesis, I'm putting

28
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:08,635
the string that I want to cast and preceeding it by the keyword float.

29
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,143
This allows me to add the input together.

30
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:23,100
Now the numbers will add up.

31
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:27,674
So we see this grad_age is the 16.55, it's a float.

32
00:02:27,675 --> 00:02:33,096
For my graduation message, I want to string concatenation and

33
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:38,119
add this age upon graduation will be plus the 16.55.

34
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,311
In order to avoid the type error,

35
00:02:41,312 --> 00:02:45,760
I'm going to change grad_age into a string.

36
00:02:53,169 --> 00:02:58,436
In order to print it, I'll just create a print statement.

37
00:03:06,893 --> 00:03:12,420
We can avoid the type error by casting to int, string, and float.
