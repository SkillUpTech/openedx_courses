Here are some tips on the true and false quiz.

1
00:00:05,823 --> 00:00:10,080
You should try to complete it without watching first.

2
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:14,310
The true false quiz has two parts.

3
00:00:14,311 --> 00:00:19,320
We're gonna create the function, and we're going to call the function

4
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:23,800
with a true false question statement and the answer.

5
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,540
So I'm going to show you how to call the true false quiz and

6
00:00:28,541 --> 00:00:30,630
you will have to write the function still.

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,340
Calling true false quiz or tf_quiz,

8
00:00:37,341 --> 00:00:40,520
I'm going to send two arguments.

9
00:00:40,521 --> 00:00:44,347
And so you'll have to create these parameters in the function.

10
00:00:44,348 --> 00:00:49,208
The first is a statement, octopuses have green blood,

11
00:00:49,209 --> 00:00:54,795
is my question statement, and the second argument is the answer

12
00:00:54,796 --> 00:01:00,080
which is that is not true because octopuses have blue blood.

13
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:07,488
And then I'm just going to print out the answer that comes back so

14
00:01:07,489 --> 00:01:09,610
let's run that code.

15
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:14,816
And we see, I can put in there that it's true and it says,

16
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:20,024
your answer is you can see it's gonna send back correct or

17
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:23,299
incorrect from the function call.

18
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,554
So we can try that again.

19
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:32,820
You can test it with false, and it says my answer is correct.

20
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:38,048
I could give it another question.

21
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:43,770
Octopuses have three hearts.

22
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,420
And we know that's true.

23
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:52,620
So let's go ahead and call the function again.

24
00:01:52,621 --> 00:01:53,590
And then you see,

25
00:01:53,591 --> 00:01:58,490
it's echoing out the new statement octopuses have three hearts.

26
00:01:58,491 --> 00:02:02,675
And maybe I think they have five and so I put in false and

27
00:02:02,676 --> 00:02:05,469
it tells me my answer is incorrect.

28
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,350
So now go ahead and write that function.
