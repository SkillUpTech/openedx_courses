    "In this module, we will start with reviewing two applications", 
    "that have made convolution networks very very popular.", 
    "The first one, image tagging.", 
    "You take an image and you give it to this trained model.", 
    "It will emit different labels that", 
    "are associated with this image and those are the image tags.", 
    "In here you can see that this is the image of a leopard", 
    "and the top five categories predicted are pretty", 
    "reasonably good, with the first one being spot on being leopard.", 
    "So this is part of a work that was done by", 
    "Alex Krizhevsky's and Hinton's research group in Toronto,", 
    "the paper is referenced here.", 
    "And it builds on top of a very popular data cell", 
    "called ImageNet.", 
    "And it has led to groundbreaking research and", 
    "breakthroughs in the area of deep learning.", 
    "Once you have tagged an image with the different tags.", 
    "The next task that automatically comes in your mind is,", 
    "where are these images.", 
    "Where are these objects located?", 
    "In this other application, which you'll see here,", 
    "we call it object detection.", 
    "The different components in the image are not only tagged but", 
    "also their bounding boxes are predicted.", 
    "This is a tutorial that is available on our CNTK", 
    "website which does object detection using Fast R-CNN.", 
    "This is hugely popular for many practical applications in", 
    "the domain built on top of image-based data.", 
    "Here you can see that within a refrigerator we are able to", 
    "detect that this is a bottle of orange juice and", 
    "this is some egg cartons in here, and so on and so forth."
