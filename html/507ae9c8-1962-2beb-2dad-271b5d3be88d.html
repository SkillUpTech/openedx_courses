<h2 id="mills-method-of-concomitant-variation">Mill's Method of Concomitant Variation</h2>
<p>Mill’s method of concomitant variation looks for changes in one phenomenon that vary with or correspond to (are concomitant with) changes in a second phenomenon. If the measured change in the one varies along with the measured change in the second, this is evidence that the two phenomena are probably causally related: one of the two probably causes the other, or some third factor is the cause of both.</p>
<p>The method of concomitant variation is often used in everyday life as well as in the laboratory setting. For instance, suppose a community college district discovers a correlation between changes in enrollment and changes in employment at the local steel mill: when employment at the mill goes down, enrollment goes up; when employment at the mill goes up, enrollment goes down. The district officials conclude that employment at the mill is one of the causes of fluctuation in college enrollment.</p>
<p>However, a word of caution: the mere fact that two phenomena are correlated does not show with certainty that they are causally related. The number of Starbucks stores per square mile and the number of churches per square mile are statistically correlated.
However, this does not prove that the presence of churches  influences where Starbucks locates its stores. Common sense suggests that there is likely a third factor behind both sets of statistics, namely, population density.</p>
<h2 id="mills-method-of-residues">Mill's Method of Residues</h2>
<p>The method of residues is common sense and takes this logical form.</p>
<ol>
<li>A, B, and C are known to cause the set of effects X, Y and Z.</li>
<li>A is found to be the cause of X.</li>
<li>B is found to be the cause of Y.</li>
<li>So, C is likely the cause of the residue Z.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, a store owner discovers that three employees, A, B, and C, have embezzled a total of $1,500 from the tills. She then verifies that A embezzled $500 and that B embezzled $800. It follows that C embezzled the residual, $200.</p>
