<p>In lesson 1 we took at look at the basics of critical thinking and how we can apply the Socratic Method to form the right questions so we can solve particular problems. In this lesson, we're going to look closer at this method and particularly at how we can apply inductive reasoning to scientific problems.</p>
<p>Computer Science as a branch of engineering is a science in its own right--as the name implies. While writing computer programs or assembling computer hardware is a highly deductive process, you must use inductive reasoning to solve many problems <em>prior to</em> actually writing code or assembling a piece of hardware. We saw an example of this in Lesson 1 of this module but let's revisit some ways that inductive reasoning can be applied in the science.</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Forming a hypothesis</strong>. Before a single line of code can be written or the first circuit board can be constructed, engineers are typically presented with a scenario to address, a problem to fix or a puzzle to solve. In order to make the first steps towards a solution, you first have to form a hypothesis about what might be the right problem and so you can apply the right solution.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Confirmation</strong>. The next step is to confirm your hypothesis is correct or if it needs modification. Suppose you are presented with a scenario in which the traffic at a particular light is always backed up at certain times of the day and you are asked to write software that will address the issue. You might formulate a hypothesis that this particular traffic light is not timed correctly -- one direction may be green for too long making the other directly green for too short a time. Before you start writing code to address the issue, you might confirm this hypothesis by running some models and tests. In this case you may write a set of programs that model the timing at the lights and the cars that go through it and change the timings to see if it has any effect on the problem.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Determining Cause and Effect</strong>. One danger in confirming or disconfirming a hypothesis is confusing correlation with causation. Causation is the direct relationship of one event with another event. Banging your fist on the desk is a direct cause of the sound that is created. Correlation is when two things happen at the same time but the one is not related to the other in a causal way. It's important to determine causal relations because if you mistake correlation for causation, you may end up solving the wrong problem!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these involves a type of inductive reasoning and it is this topic that we'll explore in this lesson.</p>
