<p>We're going to take a break from exploring formal logic to investigate how logic can be applied to analyzing and solving real-world problems. Critical thinking is a life skill that can (and we'll argue <em>should</em>) become a regular part of your way of thinking about the world. Like many skills, you probably already practice critical thinking without already knowing it and like most skills, with practice you can get better at thinking critically.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-critical-thinking">What is Critical Thinking?</h2>
<p>Although the word critical can be used to describe someone who is &quot;inclined to criticize severely and unfavorably&quot; (Merriam-Webster’s Collegiate Dictionary), the word has other uses. In  academic contexts, critical thinking carries its original Greek meaning: &quot;thinking based on criteria.&quot; A criterion (from the Greek word <em>kriterion</em>) is &quot;a test,&quot; a &quot;means of judging&quot; (<em>Dictionary.com</em>), a &quot;standard on which a judgment or decision may be based&quot; (<em>Merriam-Webster</em>). <em>Critical</em>, or <em>criterial</em>, <em>thinking</em> is thus thought that is based on standards and vetted by tests.</p>
<p>Merriam-Webster gives another meaning that dovetails with the original Greek and that also forms part of what we usually have in mind when we speak of a critical thinker today: the word critical can also stand for &quot;exercising or involving careful judgment or judicious evaluation&quot; in “an effort to see a thing clearly and truly in order to judge it fairly.” This is also part of what we have in mind when we speak of a &quot;critical care&quot; nurse or a film &quot;critic.&quot; Critical thought is therefore not simply negative or overly skeptical thinking, nor is it focused solely on finding fault or error. It is thinking guided by rational criteria that have proved to be reliable guides to good judgment and judicious evaluation.</p>
<h2 id="why-study-critical-thinking">Why Study Critical Thinking?</h2>
<p>The life you lead reflects, to a significant degree, your fundamental beliefs and values. The more critical your thinking, the more likely your fundamental beliefs and values correspond to reality, and consequently the more likely your life is rooted in reality rather than in illusion and falsehood. The study of the principles of critical thinking can sharpen your understanding of the criteria that have been found to lead to better judgments and that can help you see things as clearly and truly as possible.</p>
<p>Yet critical thinking is more than just following reliable criteria or proven standards presented in a textbook. It is as much an art as it is a science, as much a way of life as it is an exact form of thought. Socrates (470–399 BCE) was the first person in the historical record to devote his life to critical thinking by teaching it and by practicing it in a systematic way. He was also the first person to be put to death by a state for the &quot;crime&quot; of thinking critically. For these reasons, he is honored as the founder of critical thinking as a systematic discipline. It is appropriate that we begin our study with the life and thought of Socrates.</p>
