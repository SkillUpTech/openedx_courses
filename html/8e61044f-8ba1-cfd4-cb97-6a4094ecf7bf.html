<p>We learned in the last couple of lessons that we construct arguments using statements that declare something to be true. But what if we need to rephrase a statement or translate the statement into another language? Does this change the argument?</p>
<p>Let's look at an analogous problem in metaphysics in order to tackle this problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sidebar: Philosophical metaphysics is the study of being and existence. It comes from the Greek words &quot;meta&quot; -- above and &quot;phusike&quot; -- matter: that which comes before the study of the physical world. The discipline attempts to come up with definitions for existence and studies things like relations, identity, change, cause and effect and similar subjects.</p>

<h2 id="the-number-two">The Number Two</h2>
<p>What is this:</p>
<h3 id="section">2</h3>
<p>If you said &quot;the number 2&quot; you'd be wrong. That's actually the <em>numeral</em> 2. Notice that you can take a pen and paper and write a numeral 2 on that paper or you may have many numeral 2s on the calendar on your wall. What do all these numeral 2s have in common? They represent, symbolize or point to something else: the number 2!</p>
<p>Metaphysicians make this distinction by examining each thing's  <em>properties</em>. Properties are just the aspects of things that make them the same or different. Suppose you took a red marker and drew a numeral 2 on a piece of paper about 5 inches tall. That numeral 2 has specific properties. It is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Red</li>
<li>Five inches tall</li>
<li>Made up of chemicals (the chemicals of the marker)</li>
<li>It's even located somewhere: on your desk which can be determined by GPS!</li>
</ul>
<p>Now ask yourself: does the number 2 have those properties? Is the number 2 red? Is it 5 inches tall? Is it located somewhere? The answers to all these questions seem to be no. So the numeral 2 on your desk seems to be different than the number 2. What are the properties of the number 2? Well, we can say it's <em>even</em> and <em>greater than 1 and less than 3</em> and <em>can be used in mathematical operations like addition</em>. None of these properties seem to be true of the numeral 2.</p>
<p>So these property differences give us at least a superficial reason to think the numeral 2 is a symbol for the number 2 and that the two things are different. To emphasize this, notice that you can symbolize the number 2 in a variety of ways: using dots, your voice, or chickens. As long as the thing you're using points to the number, you can symbolize it almost any way you like!</p>
<p>Okay, we acknowledge that this story requires that you buy into a lot of complicated metaphysics that are hotly debated by philosophers and mathematicians alike. But for the purposes of this lesson, it's not important that you understand or agree with all of the metaphysics presented above. The main takeaway is that you can see the difference between a symbol and the thing the symbol symbolizes. This is going to relate directly the problem we introduced at the beginning of this lesson.</p>
<p>Well dig into this a bit more deeply in the next lesson.</p>
