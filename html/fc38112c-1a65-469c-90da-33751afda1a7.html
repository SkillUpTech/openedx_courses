<p>The disjunction operator creates a compound statement that is true if either simple statement is true but false if both simple statements are false.</p>
<p><strong>Symbol</strong>: v . This is the letter V on English keyboards</p>
<p><strong>Symbol Name</strong>: Wedge</p>
<p><strong>Parts of Disjunction</strong>: Two simple statements joined by the disjunction symbol. Each simple statement in a disjunction is called a <strong>disjunct</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: For the two simple statements &quot;Ann is home&quot; (A) and &quot;Bob is home&quot; (B) a disjunction would look like this:</p>
<p>A v B or Ann is home OR Bob is home.</p>
<p>With disjunction we can see that if either disjunct is true the compound statement is true because &quot;or&quot; communicates that either could be true. But if both disjuncts are false the disjunction is false.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If you've done certain types of math or computer programming, you might be familiar with &quot;exclusive or&quot; or XOR which states that the entire statement is true only if each disjunct differs in truth value (one is true and one is false). Disjunction is not XOR. Disjunction is true if either disjunct is <em>or both</em> disjuncts are true and false only if both are false -- sometimes called &quot;inclusive or&quot;.</p>
