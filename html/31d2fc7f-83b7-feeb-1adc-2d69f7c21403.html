<p>The last lesson taught us that a variety of symbols can be used to point to something common. I can use stars, **, to symbolize the number 2 for example. This applies directly to our problem of statements and how they're used in arguments.</p>
<h2 id="propositions">Propositions</h2>
<p>We saw earlier that statements are <em>linguistic</em>. That is statements essentially are sentences that are spoken or written in some language. These are not the things that the logical relation relates. They only symbolize the thing we care about in logic: propositions.</p>
<p>Philosopher Peter van Inwagen defines a proposition as a &quot;non-linguistic bearer of truth value&quot;. Put more simply, a proposition is the <em>meaning</em> behind a declarative statement and it is the thing that is true or false. A statement then <em>symbolizes</em> some proposition.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Consider the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pat likes Jan</li>
<li>Jan is liked by Pat</li>
</ol>
<p>These are two different English sentences. The first has three words and the second has 5. In the first sentence, the word &quot;Pat&quot; comes first and &quot;Jan&quot; is first in the second. You get the idea. The relevant question here is do they <em>mean</em> the same thing? Do the sentences symbolize or represent <em>the same idea</em>? The most straightforward answer is: yes they do. Here's another example:</p>
<ol>
<li>The moon has craters</li>
<li>La luna tiene cr√°teres</li>
</ol>
<p>Here we have two sentences in different languages. But we would say the Spanish sentence <em>means the same thing as</em> the English sentence. Using the vocabulary of the last couple of lessons, we can say that both sentences <em>symbolize</em> the same thing, the same proposition.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-this-matter">Why does this matter?</h2>
<p>Let's return to the example from a previous lesson.</p>
<ol>
<li>The epistemic position of the defense side of the litigation lacks justificatory veracity.</li>
<li>The defendant failed to make her case.</li>
</ol>
<p>We can use these two statements in a logical argument interchangeably <em>as long as they both express the same meaning</em>. But for clarity, we might choose sentence 2 over sentence one because it's easier to understand (depending on the context and audience and other factors).</p>

<p>The value of understanding propositions is to prevent us from getting too bogged down in syntax (or word choice). While word choice can be very important, becoming overly attached to a word can sometimes derail getting at the broader meaning of what one intends to say.</p>
<p>One application of this principle is rewording an argument in order to make it easier to work with. We may need to reword a proposition to express the idea in simple sentences if the original argument wasn't written that way. As long as the rewording expresses the exact same idea--the same proposition-- this is allowed!</p>
