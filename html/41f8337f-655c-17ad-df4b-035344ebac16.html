<p>Now that we know what a deductive argument is and what makes a deductive argument valid or invalid, we can now learn some valid forms. Each of these syllogism are deductive arguments that you can use to construct your own arguments. Each is valid and if you examine the structure of each argument and apply the rule we learned, you should be able to see why.</p>
<h2 id="modus-ponens">Modus Ponens</h2>
<p>The <em>modus ponens</em> argument is an argument where you assert something is true. You &quot;put forth&quot; the proposition. So in this argument, you are in &quot;the mode of putting&quot; forth a true premise. That's what &quot;modus ponens&quot; means--the mode of putting. Here's the form:</p>
<ol>
<li>If p then q (p --&gt; q)</li>
<li>p</li>
<li>Therefore q</li>
</ol>
<p>In the second premise, you assert as true the antecedent of the conditional of the first premise. This allows you to conclude the consequent of the conditional in the first premise. This is because the conditional in the first premise tells us that if p is true, q must follow with logical necessity. Here's an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Jerry grows a mustache then George will grow a mustache</li>
<li>Jerry grows a mustache</li>
<li>Therefore, George will grow a mustache</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="modus-tollens">Modus Tollens</h2>
<p>The <em>modus tollens</em> form is similar to the <em>modus ponens</em> except in the second premise, we're going to negate the consequent of the conditional in the first premise and this will result in negating the antecedent of the conditional in the first premise. Here's the form:</p>
<ol>
<li>If p then q (p --&gt; q)</li>
<li>It is not the case that q (~q)</li>
<li>Therefore, it is not the case that p (~p)</li>
</ol>
<p>So in the second premise, we're <em>taking away</em> the consequent or we're in the &quot;mode of taking&quot; or negating the consequent. That's what <em>modus tollens</em> means: the mode of taking. Here's an example:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you are taking a MOOC course then you are busy studying</li>
<li>It is not the case that you're busy studying</li>
<li>Therefore, it is not the case that you're taking a MOOC course</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the first premise, the conditional, states that if you're taking a MOOC it is necessarily true that you're busy studying. Put another way, it's not <em>possible</em> that you're not busy studying if you're taking a MOOC. So, in premise 2, if we say you're not busy studying, then it's impossible that you're taking a MOOC.</p>
