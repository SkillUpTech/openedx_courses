<p>During the Middle Ages, logicians assigned Latin names to the fifteen forms of syllogism first proved valid by Aristotle. These syllogisms were arranged into four groups known as &ldquo;figures.&rdquo; The exact logical form for a syllogism is specified by giving the type (A, E, I, or O) for each sentence followed by the number of the syllogism&rsquo;s figure.</p>
<p>It's not necessary that you memorize all these forms but do become familiar with their general structure. You can use this topic as a reference when you're constructing your own arguments.</p>
