<p>A strong inductive argument with true premises is considered <em>cogent</em>. Like with deductive arguments, determining cogency is a two-step process. First determine the strength of the argument. A weak inductive argument is always uncogent. So if you can determine the argument is weak, you don't need to go any further.</p>
<p>If you determine that an argument is strong, then determine whether the premises are true. If they are, then you have a cogent inductive argument.</p>
<p>Here are examples of cogent inductive arguments:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has rained over 20 inches per year in Seattle for last 20 years.</li>
<li>It will rain in Seattle again this year</li>
<li>Therefore it probably will rain over 20 inches over the course of the year.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's a cogent inductive argument in the form of a narrative:</p>
<p>&quot;Each snow crystal contains about a quintillion water molecules, and these molecules can be arranged in countless numbers of ways. Of course, no one can prove it, but it is quite likely that every snowflake is unique.&quot; â€“Scott Camazine, <em>The Naturalist's Year</em></p>
