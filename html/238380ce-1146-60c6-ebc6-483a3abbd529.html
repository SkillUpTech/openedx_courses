<p>Socrates (470–399 BCE) stands out as one of the most influential figures in all of human history. Although he never wrote a book, led a conquering army, painted a masterpiece, or held high office, few individuals have made such a lasting impression on their fellow human beings and on the history of the world. By day, he supported his family, working (off and on) as a stonecutter, in the Greek city-state of Athens, the place of his birth. But his real profession, and his life’s passion, was the discipline the ancient Greeks had only recently named philosophy (from the Greek <em>philein</em>, &quot;to love,&quot; and <em>sophia</em> for &quot;wisdom,&quot; literally &quot;the love of wisdom&quot;).</p>
<p>When Socrates was around forty, an incident occurred that would change his life forever. In ancient Greece, an oracle was someone believed to be channeling the gods. The most famous oracle in Socrates’s day was the priestess at the Temple of Apollo, located at Delphi.</p>
<p>People from all over Greece traveled to this sacred spot to ask the Pythia (her title) important questions. (The oracle in the movie <em>The Matrix</em> was based on the Oracle of Delphi. Alexander the Great traveled to Delphi to question the Pythia before embarking on his conquest of the Middle East.) When the session began, supernatural vapors would rise from the underworld, the Pythia (seated on a tripod and attended by temple priests) would fall into a trance, and the god would speak through her. (Modern scientists suspect the temple was located over a geological vent that released intoxicating underground gases that produced the effect. Archeologists have discovered chasms in the area releasing ethylene -- a gas that has been used as an anesthetic and that is actually capable of producing a trancelike state.)</p>
<p>One day, Chaerephon, a childhood friend of Socrates’s, traveled to Delphi to ask the oracle the following question: Is anyone wiser than Socrates? Her reply would become famous. “Of all men living Socrates is most wise.” Socrates’s first response upon hearing the prophecy was disbelief. Many years later, in a public speech given only days before the end of his life, he looked back on the event:</p>
<p style="margin-left:50px">What could the god mean? . . . For some time I was frankly puzzled . . . but at last I embarked on my quest. I went to a man with a high reputation for wisdom -- I would rather not mention his name; he was one of the politicians -- and after some talk together it began to dawn on me that, wise as everyone thought him and wise as he thought himself, he was not really wise at all. I tried to point this out to him, but then he turned nasty, and so did others who were listening; so I went away, but with this reflection that anyhow I was wiser than this man; for, though in all probability neither of us knows anything, he thought he did when he did not, whereas I neither knew anything nor imagined I did. (Plato’s <i>Gorgias</i>, 495)</p>
<p>Socrates now began questioning people from all walks of life, from all around the city, about what they believed and why they believed it. He discovered that many people thought they knew all about some subject, when in reality they knew little about it. In fact, many were extremely ignorant. He also questioned experts famous for their knowledge of some subject matter, only to discover that although everyone believed these experts knew it all,and although they smugly believed they knew, they did not know what they were talking about. Their alleged expertise was a mirage.</p>
<p>Socrates believed that Chaerphon’s trip to Delphi and the message from the oracle
were not accidents. He said, in utter seriousness, &quot;The god has commanded me that
I should live philosophizing, examining myself and others.&quot; With his eyes now opened to the pervasiveness of human ignorance and to the way it diminishes the human
condition, Socrates had a new mission in life: to help people discover their own ignorance as a first step to the attainment of wisdom. To know nothing about a subject and to be aware of that ignorance, he argued, is better than to think one knows it all while actually knowing nothing. Knowledge of one’s ignorance is thus itself a form of wisdom.</p>
<p>Indeed, this knowledge, he now believed, is the first step to true wisdom, and to human excellence. Imagine what society would be like if each person pursued wisdom and
excellence with fervor.</p>
<p>There are several important points to notice here.</p>
<ol>
<li>Some people, upon hearing that they have been called the wisest person of all—and by a god no less—would become puffed up with pride. Not Socrates. He initially does not believe he is wise, and is not afraid to say so. This is the response of a man who is humble. Incidentally, Socrates does not intend us to take him literally when he says that he knows “absolutely nothing.” His words are best interpreted as an expression of his characteristic modesty.</li>
<li>Socrates does not take the Pythia’s statement for granted. He questions it, and most importantly, tests it (by going out into the marketplace and questioning people known for their wisdom). Socrates believes that questionable claims need to be tested by reasoning and observation, no matter who makes them, even if they come from a god.</li>
<li>Socrates makes his discovery about the pervasiveness of ignorance through conversations with others. Time and again he demonstrates that we learn a great deal about life, and about ourselves, in conversation with fellow human beings.</li>
<li>When Socrates investigates the matter, he does not go to an authority and beg hat in hand for an infallible answer. He looks, observes, reasons, and talks with people; in short, he searches on his own and thinks for himself.</li>
</ol>
<p>Just as a builder must clear away brush before building a house, Socrates would say, one must clear away ignorance before building wisdom. Socrates was now convinced that self-knowledge is the basis for true wisdom and human excellence. In the marketplace, his conversations shifted from the big questions of cosmology and physics to the human condition, and to that which he now believed to be the most important question of all: What is the best life for a human being to live, all things considered? The Socratic method was taking form.</p>
