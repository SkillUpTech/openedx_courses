<p>In this section, we took a look at the basic structure of a computing device called a <strong>Turing Machine</strong>. We then briefly looked at how computers process information and related the basic functioning of a computer to formal logic.</p>
<p>Then we saw that <strong>arguments</strong> are the object of logical analysis and are made up of <strong>premises</strong>, a <strong>conclusion</strong> and a <strong>logical relation</strong>. The premises and conclusion of an argument are written as statements which are symbolic representations of meaning or what logicians call <strong>propositions</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, we saw that propositions have a <strong>truth value</strong> which is the truth or falsity of a proposition at a given time. We now have the basic foundation from which we can begin to construct and analyze arguments. We'll dig into that further in the next module.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this module, we'll begin to explore one way we can apply formal logic to our lives and even to designing and developing computer programs: critical thinking.</p>
