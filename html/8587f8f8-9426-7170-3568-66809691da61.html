<p>Recall that a categorical syllogism has two premises and a conclusion. A set of three interlocking Venn circles can be drawn to represent the information content and logical structure of an entire categorical syllogism. Once the diagram is drawn, we can determine, just from a visual inspection of the circles, whether or not the argument is valid. The first step is to set up the circles correctly. In the following example, S stands for the minor term, P stands for the major term, and M stands for the middle term. The circle labeled S represents the category of things referred to by the minor term, circle P represents the category of things referred to by the major term, and circle M represents the category of things referred to by the middle term.</p>

<p>To represent all the logical possibilities, the Venn circles must overlap to form the seven different areas numbered by convention shown here. Each of these areas, starting in order from the top, and dropping down and moving from left to right as one would read an English text, represents a different class of things:</p>
<p>Area 1: Anything here is an M, but not an S, and not a P.</p>
<p>Area 2: Anything here is an S and an M, but not a P.</p>
<p>Area 3: Anything here is an S, a P, and an M.</p>
<p>Area 4: Anything here is a P and an M, but not an S.</p>
<p>Area 5: Anything here is an S, but not an M and not a P.</p>
<p>Area 6: Anything here is an S and a P, but not an M.</p>
<p>Area 7: Anything here is a P, but not an S, and not an M.</p>
<p>Area 8: Things out here would be neither P, S, nor M.</p>
<p>In the next topic, we'll start to look at how to use Venn Diagrams to test categorical syllogisms for validity.</p>
