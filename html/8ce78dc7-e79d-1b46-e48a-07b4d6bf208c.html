<p>As we saw in earlier lessons, deductive arguments can be valid or invalid. A valid deductive argument is an argument that is written in a particular form and follows the rule: if the premises are considered true, the conclusion is necessarily true. If the premises are consider true but there is at least one case where the conclusion is false, then the argument is not in valid form.</p>
<p>Categorical syllogisms adhere to the same principles. You learned in the last lesson that there are a set of valid logical forms for categorical statements and you can test a categorical syllogism for validity by verifying that the syllogism matches the structure of one of those forms. But there's another way to test for validity that doesn't require you to know or even reference those forms.</p>
<h2 id="the-venn-diagram">The Venn Diagram</h2>
<p>In the nineteenth century, the English logician and philosopher John Venn (1834– 1923) revolutionized categorical logic by inventing a radically different way to test categorical syllogisms for validity and invalidity. Venn’s method allows us to visually represent the information content of categorical sentences in such a way that we can actually see the relations between the sentences of a syllogism. This, in turn, allows us to determine validity and invalidity visually simply by looking at a diagram. When matters get extremely complex, it is always nice when we can draw a picture. This was an enormous leap forward for logical theory.</p>
<p>A Venn diagram is a set of overlapping circles, with each circle standing for a category or class of things, and with the circles arranged so as to display the logical relationships between the categories represented. A Venn diagram for a single categorical
statement has two overlapping circles, one standing for the category named by the subject term and one representing the category named by the predicate term, producing four distinct areas, or regions.</p>
<p>Consider the following categorial statement, All As are Bs and the following diagram:</p>
<img src="/static/VennRegions.png" alt="Diagram showing the four regions of a Venn Diagram for Categorical Statements Image" title="">
<p>The A circle represents all the things in the universe that are A, while the B circle represents all the things that are B. If the As are aardvarks, the A circle represents all aardvarks; if the Bs are brown things, then the B circle represents all the things that are
brown, and so forth. Thus:</p>
<p>Region 1 represents things that are A, but not B.</p>
<p>Region 2 represents things that are both A and B.</p>
<p>Region 3 represents things that are B, but not A.</p>
<p>Region 4 (the area outside the circles) represents everything that is neither A nor B.</p>
<h2 id="creating-venn-diagrams-for-categorical-statements">Creating Venn Diagrams for Categorical Statements</h2>
<p>Information is entered into a Venn diagram in three ways: we shade an area to indicate that the area is empty. (Note that in many math contexts using Venn diagrams, shading means the opposite; i.e., that the quadrant is full.) We place an X in an area to say that the area contains at least one thing. In addition, we will adopt the following convention: If two areas have been defined and we know that something exists in one of the two areas but we do not know which of the two areas contains the item, we straddle the line, that is, we will place the X directly on the line separating the two areas. An X straddling a line will therefore indicate that (a) an item exists on one side or the other of the line but (b) the available information does not tell us which side of the line contains the entity in question.</p>

<p>Note: The Aristotelian Assumption
The system of principles of categorical logic developed by Aristotle rested on a nonobvious assumption, namely, the assumption that the subject terms of categorical statements
refer to actually existing things. This assumption is known in logic as the existential assumption. It is also called the “Aristotelian assumption,” the “traditional assumption,” and the “assumption of existential import.”</p>
<p>A statement is said to have existential import if its subject term refers to one or more actually existing things. A statement lacks existential import if its subject term does not refer to one or more actually existing things. For example, the statement “All unicorns are magical flying creatures” obviously lacks existential import because unicorns do not actually exist. We say that the subject term in this case (unicorns) is an empty term because the category it refers to does not contain any actually existing entities. In contrast, the statement “Some cats are pets” has existential import because at least one cat exists. The term cats is thus not an empty term. Aristotle thus assumed that all categorical statements under consideration have existential import—they are all about existing things.</p>
<p>In this course, our Venn diagrams will follow a convention that does not include the existential assumption for simplicity purposes. This follows the approach taken by logician George Boole (1815-1864) and is called the Boolean viewpoint.</p>
