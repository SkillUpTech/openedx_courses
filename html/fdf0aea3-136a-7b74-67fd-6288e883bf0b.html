<p>Suppose four students eat lunch in the school cafeteria, and later in the afternoon all four become sick. What is the cause of the illness? The health department would probably
begin its investigation by asking each student what he or she ate for lunch. Suppose the information is compiled on the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Fries</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Salad</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Fish Sticks</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Burger</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Soup</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Student 1</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Student 2</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Student 3</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Student 4</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Notice that each ate different items, with one exception: the salad. Given that the salad was the only factor all four cases had in common, the conclusion is that the salad is the probable cause of the illness. In a case like this, the health department would probably take samples of the salad and test them in its laboratory. The logical process illustrated in this case is Mill's <em>method of agreement</em>.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is that the probable cause of the effect E (the sickness) is to be found in the one antecedent condition common to each case where the effect is present. Of course, it is possible that something else, in addition to the salad, contributed to the outbreak. The cause identified by the method
of agreement is likely a necessary cause—a necessary condition for the effect under investigation.</p>
<p>The method of agreement requires that we draw up a list of possible causes. We use our background knowledge of cause-and-effect connections when we do this. Next we look for one antecedent causal factor common to all cases of the effect in question. This common factor, if found, is identified as the
probable necessary condition or as part of the necessary condition. Note that the conclusion is not that the condition singled out must be the cause; the conclusion is only that this is probably the cause (or is part of the cause).</p>
