<p>In the previous topic we saw how Venn diagrams can represent the classes or categories of categorical statements. Since each of the forms have an established pattern, we can create Venn diagrams for each of the valid forms.</p>

<h3 id="the-i-statement">The 'I' Statement</h3>
<p>A particular statement is only true when its terms refer to one or more actually existing things, Using obvious abbreviations (A for “aardvarks,” etc.), the Venn diagram for the I statement “Some aardvarks are mammals” therefore looks like this:</p>
<img src="/static/VennIStatement.png" alt="Diagram showing the Venn Diagram for categorical I statements Image" title="">
<p>You might find it helpful to imagine all the aardvarks in the universe rounded up and rooting around for ants inside the first circle—the A circle. Likewise, imagine all the mammals in the universe collected and resting inside the second circle—the M circle. The X indicates that there is at least one thing existing in the part of the aardvark region that overlaps with the mammal region. That is, some aardvarks are mammals. Notice that we did not put an X in region 3. Independent of the diagram, we might know that there are creatures in region 3—there are mammals that are not aardvarks—but the I statement does not tell us this, and we wish to diagram only the information the statement gives, and nothing more. Region 3 therefore gets no X.</p>
<h3 id="the-o-statement">The 'O' Statement</h3>
<p>The following is the Venn diagram for the O sentence “Some cats are not pets”:</p>
<img src="/static/VennOStatement.png" alt="Diagram showing the Venn Diagram for categorical O statements Image" title="">
<p>Region 1 represents things that are cats but not pets, region 2 represents cats that are pets, and region 3 represents pets that are not cats. The X tells us there is at least one thing “inside” area 1.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: If no X or shading appears in an area, this does not say that nothing exists in the area; rather, it indicates that nothing is known of the area. It only means we have no information about the area. Thus, for all we know, the area might be empty, or it  might contain one or more things.</p>
