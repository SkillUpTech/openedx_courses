<p>As we saw in a previous lesson, simple statements can be joined to other simple statements to create compound statements. A simple statement declares that something is true. In order to make arguments easier to manage and determine the truth value of each part of your argument, you should break down all statements to simple statements whenever possible.</p>
<p>For example, take this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern computer systems are Turing machines that can process trillions of operations per second though the basic operations are extremely simple: they essentially transition states from 1 through 4 or on, semi-on, sort-of-on, and off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How many truth statements are made in this sentence? If you were to give a single truth value to the entire statement, what would it be? If you are having difficulty figuring that out, try this rewording:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modern computer systems are Turing machines AND modern computers can process trillions of operations per second BUT the basic operations of computer systems are extremely simple AND modern computer systems transition states from 1 through 4 or on, semi-on, sort-of-on, and off.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now it should be easier to see all the truth statements that are made. The &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;BUT&quot; words separate the simple statements. There are 4 separate statements of truth (with the truth value of each in parentheses:</p>
<ol>
<li>Modern computer systems are Turing machines (T)</li>
<li>Modern computers can process trillions of operations per second (T)</li>
<li>The basic operations of computer systems are extremely simple (T)</li>
<li>Modern computer systems transition states from 1 through 4: on, semi-on, sort-of-on, and off (F)</li>
</ol>
<p>Statement 4 is false because a Turing machine just transitions states between 1 and 0.</p>
<p>AND and BUT help us separate the simple statements and help us combine simple statements into a compound statement but we're able to easier manage the truth value of each simple statement. This is the value of using <em>logical operators</em> to construct compound statements.</p>
