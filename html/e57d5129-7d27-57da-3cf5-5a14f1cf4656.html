<h2 id="argument-form">Argument form</h2>
<p>We've already learned that for deductive arguments, if the premises are true, then the conclusion must be true. But true premises are not enough for a deductive argument to yield a true conclusion. Consider the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the water is at 100 degrees centigrade, then it boils</li>
<li>Water is made up of hydrogen and oxygen molecules</li>
<li>Therefore the water is boiling</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice in this argument, both premises 1 and 2 are true but it doesn't necessarily mean that the conclusion is true. This is because the premises do not stand in the right relationship to each other. Now consider this argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the water is at 100 degrees centigrade, then it boils</li>
<li>The water is at 100 degrees centigrade</li>
<li>Therefore, the water boils</li>
</ol>
<p>Here's another:</p>
<ol>
<li>All humans are rational</li>
<li>All rational things are conscious</li>
<li>Therefore, all humans are conscious</li>
</ol>
<p>In these arguments, the two true premises are related properly so that the conclusion must be true given the truth of those premises. This structure is an example of what logicians call proper <strong>argument form</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="valid-and-invalid-forms">Valid and Invalid Forms</h2>
<p>Deductive arguments in an argument form where true premises result in a conclusion that must be true are called <strong>valid</strong> arguments. Deductive arguments that are not in a valid form are called <strong>invalid</strong> arguments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Test for Validity:</strong> Logicians have come up with a set of valid forms that we will study later but an easy test for validity is to ask yourself the following question: "If I assume the premises are true, is it possible that the conclusion could be false." If you answer "yes" then the argument is invalid and valid if you answer "no". One way to determine whether the conclusion can be false is to find a <em>counterexample</em>: a real-world situation where the premises are true but the conclusion is still false. We can call this the "intuitive test" for validity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above test for validity is foolproof and even works if you don't know the meaning of the terms in the argument. Consider this argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>All grue are fizznit</li>
<li>Jabby is a grue</li>
<li>Therefore, jabby is a fizznit</li>
</ol>
<p>Jabby, grue, and fizznit are nonsense terms that have no meaning but you can still see that the argument is valid. This is because the rule states that <em>if you assume the premises are true</em> and then determine that the conclusion must be true, the argument is valid. This shows us something important: its not the truth of the premises that makes an argument valid but rather the form its in. We can say this another way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deductive arguments with actually false premises can still be valid</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact you can determine validity even if the argument doesn't have any terms at all. We briefly looked at this when we studied symbolization and we'll see how this works more deeply in the next section.</p>
<h2 id="invalid-arguments">Invalid arguments</h2>
<p>In order to illustrate the concept of validity further, lets look at arguments where the premises <strong>do not</strong> lead to a certainly true conclusion because the structure is poor or <strong>invalid arguments</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>All humans are rational</li>
<li>Some rational things are conscious</li>
<li>Therefore all humans are conscious</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an invalid argument. Its similar to the valid argument above but did you notice what changed? We replaced the term "all" in the second premise with "some" and that made the argument invalid. In logic, the term "some" means "at least one" so the second premise can be reworded as "at least one rational thing is conscious. It could be the case that the one rational thing is not a human being so it's possible that the conclusion is false. Therefore the argument is not valid. Here's another example using a different argument form:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you program computers, then you&rsquo;re familiar with JavaScript</li>
<li>You&rsquo;re familiar with JavaScript</li>
<li>Therefore, you program computers</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that the first premise tells us that it must follow that you're familiar with JavaScript&nbsp;<em>if</em> you program computers. It doesn't tell us anything about whether you program computers given that you are familiar with JavaScript. Here's another invalid argument in the same form that may make this point clearer:</p>
<ol>
<li>If Alan Turing died in 1954, then he was born in or prior to 1954</li>
<li>Alan Turing was born in or prior to 1954</li>
<li>Therefore, Alan Turing died in 1954</li>
</ol>
<p>Premise 1 tells us that if Alan Turing died in 1954 he must have been born in that year or prior to it but doesn't indicate any relationship the year of his birth and when he must have died. So the conclusion is possibly false even though the premises are true making the argument invalid.</p>
