<p>Recall that an inductive argument aims to show that if its premises all are true, then its conclusion, although not certain to be true, is probably true. (Recall also that by probably
we mean “better than 50 percent likely.”) If an inductive argument succeeds in this aim, we call it a strong inductive argument. A strong argument thus has this feature: if its
premises all are true, then its conclusion is probable, although not certain. An inductive argument that is not strong is said to be a weak inductive argument. A weak inductive argument is therefore an inductive argument in which it is not the case that if its premises all are true, then its conclusion is probably true. Methodical and intuitive procedures exist for the evaluation of inductive arguments; however, inductive arguments can take many different forms and the procedures vary from one form of inductive argument to another. We have space to examine three common forms of inductive reasoning.</p>
<h2 id="arguing-by-analogy">Arguing by Analogy</h2>
<p>An analogical argument begins by asserting that two things, call them “X” and “Y,” have many features in common. This establishes an analogy (similarity) between X and Y. Next, an additional feature of X is identified—something not known to not be
possessed by Y. The conclusion is that Y probably has this feature as well. For instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Monkeys and humans have similar hearts.</li>
<li>Drug X cures heart disease in monkeys.</li>
<li>Therefore, drug X will likely cure heart disease in humans.</li>
</ol>
<p>A great deal of medical research is based on analogical reasoning. We reason this way often in everyday life.</p>
<h2 id="enumerative-induction">Enumerative Induction</h2>
<p>Imagine that a professional dog-trainer with six large dogs just moved into the house next door. For the first week, every night at 1:00 a.m. he lets his dogs out in the yard for exercise. Every time, they run around and bark like crazy. It is 1 am on the eighth night and you naturally expect to hear dogs barking any minute. Your reasoning is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The dogs barked at 1 a.m. the first night.</li>
<li>The dogs barked at 1:00 a.m. the second night. (and so forth)</li>
<li>Therefore, they will probably bark tonight.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your reasoning has taken the form of an enumerative induction. In such an argument, the premises list or enumerate information about a series of individuals or cases; a pattern is observed; and then a conclusion is drawn that extends that pattern to the
next individual case, or to a whole group of like things. Essentially, this kind of inductive argument begins with a series of observations or cases and then extends the series
to one or more new (unobserved) cases. The reasoning is inductive because the argument aims to show only that the conclusion is probable, not that the conclusion is
completely certain.</p>
<h2 id="inference-to-the-best-explanation">Inference to the Best Explanation</h2>
<p>An inference to the best explanation occurs when we begin with one or more facts in need of explanation and then decide what to infer by thinking about what would best explain those facts. More formally, an inference to the best explanation typically takes the following form:</p>
<ol>
<li>Begin with one or more facts in need of explanation.</li>
<li>Critically examine as many initially plausible potential explanations as possible (where a potential explanation is one that, if true, would explain the facts in question, and a plausible explanation is one that is consistent with general background information).</li>
<li>Rank one explanation as the best explanation on the basis of the standard criteria.</li>
<li>Conclude that the explanation ranked as the best explanation is probably true.</li>
</ol>
