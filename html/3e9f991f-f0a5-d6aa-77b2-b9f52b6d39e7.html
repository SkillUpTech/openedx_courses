<p>In mathematics, we can use symbols in equations and formulas and we can replace those symbols with a variety of numbers and the equations still work. For example, we could create an addition formula using symbols:</p>
<p>x + 1 = y</p>
<p>We either could replace x with a number and solve for y or replace y with a number and solve for x.</p>
<p>Similarly, we can symbolize propositions in deductive arguments and from the symbolic form alone, we can better see the argument's structure.</p>

<p>Suppose I want to argue that all humans belong to the class of things that are both rational and conscious. I might create this argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>All humans are rational</li>
<li>All rational things are conscious</li>
<li>Therefore, all humans are conscious</li>
</ol>
<p>Now let's do this:</p>
<p>Let H stand for human, R stand for rational, and C stand for conscious and write our argument as:</p>
<ol>
<li>All H are R</li>
<li>All R are C</li>
<li>Therefore All H are C</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that we can also replace H, C, and R with any term and it doesn't change the overall <em>structure</em> of the argument. Replace H with &quot;haberdashery&quot;, R with &quot;ripe&quot; and C with &quot;crazy&quot;. We now have:</p>
<ol>
<li>All haberdashery are ripe</li>
<li>All ripe things are crazy</li>
<li>Therefore all haberdashery are crazy</li>
</ol>
<p>The argument is non-sensical but it retains the same structure and we'll see why that is important in an upcoming lesson.</p>
<p>So using symbols, we can separate the <em>structure</em> of an argument from its content and this will be key to breaking down arguments for analysis.</p>
