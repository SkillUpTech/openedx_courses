<p>Welcome to <strong>DEV262x: Logic and Computational Thinking</strong>.  I've worked hard to bring you this introductory course where you will learn fundamentals of formal logic and how these concepts apply both to computer science and your life!</p>
<p>If you ever see any bugs, typos, issues or simply want to make suggestions; the course staff regularly monitors the discussion forums for this course.</p>
<h3 id="course-overview">Course Overview</h3>
<p>In this course, you will build a solid foundation for work in computer science by learning basic logic and how logic forms the foundation of rational thought and then applying some of those concepts to computer programming structures and techniques.</p>
<p>Understanding how a computer &quot;thinks&quot; is one of the first steps to becoming an excellent computer programmer and a foundation in logic is crucial in developing this understanding. Mastering logic is more than learning a set of rules and involves learning how to break problems into smaller chunks, figuring out how repeatable processes can save time and improve quality, and understanding how to organize problems into the right size. In this course, you'll learn how to do all those things and use computers to make them easier because these are things computers are good at doing!</p>
<p>Here's what you'll be learning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical form and how to construct arguments</li>
<li>Deductive and inductive argument forms</li>
<li>The basics of critical thinking</li>
<li>How to break down problems into simpler tasks</li>
<li>Recognize patterns and understand why this is important</li>
<li>How to use algorithm to solve problems</li>
<li>The relation of logic to fundamentals in computer science</li>
</ul>
