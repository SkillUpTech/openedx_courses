<p>The conjunction operator creates a compound statement such that in order for the whole statement to be true, each simple statement has to be true. This should make intuitive sense as you see how conjunction works.</p>
<p><strong>Symbol</strong>: &amp; or · . You can use either symbol for conjunction (some logic text books use one and other textbooks use the other)</p>
<p><strong>Symbol Name</strong>: Ampersand or dot</p>
<p><strong>Parts of Conjunction</strong>: Two simple statements joined by the conjunction symbol. Each simple statement in a conjunction is called a <strong>conjunct</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: For the two simple statements &quot;Ann is home&quot; (A) and &quot;Bob is home&quot; (B) a conjunction would look like this:</p>
<p>A &amp; B (A · B) or Ann is home AND Bob is home.</p>
<p>As we said above, if either conjunct is false, the entire conjunction is false. This should make intuitive sense. If Ann is home but Bob is not home we would say that it isn't true that both Ann and Bob are home--which is what the conjunction compound statement is claiming.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At this point let's revisit the idea of truth-functional compound statements we learned in an earlier lesson. We can see how the individual simple statements have a truth value but the compound statement <em>as a whole</em> also has a truth value based on the work the operator does on those simple statements: the simple statements are the &quot;inputs&quot; and the conjunction is the &quot;function&quot; that operates (in truth value terms) on the simple statements to produce a single truth value.</p>
