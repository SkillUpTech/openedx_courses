<p>Since deductive arguments are all about the necessary relationships between the premises and conclusion, the form is very important and we examined the form in the concept of validity and invalidity. As we saw in an earlier lesson, inductive arguments are all about the <em>content</em> of the premises and involve probability so validity doesn't apply to inductive arguments. Instead, logicians focus on the <em>strength</em> of inductive arguments.</p>
<h2 id="strong-inductive-arguments">Strong Inductive Arguments</h2>
<p>In a strong inductive argument, if the premises are assumed true, it is <em>likely</em> that the conclusion is true (though the conclusion could be false). If the conclusion is likely to not be true based on the assumed truth of the premises, the inductive argument is weak.</p>
<p>It's important to note that strength is a factor of to what degree the premises support the conclusion <em>on the assumption</em> that the premises are true and this is the case even if you know one or more of the premises are false. For example, the following is a strong inductive argument even though the premise is false:</p>
<ol>
<li>All meteorites found to this day have contained gold</li>
<li>Therefore, probably the next meteorite found will contain gold</li>
</ol>
<p>You may be able to see that the premise does support the conclusion to a high degree of probability and that's all we care about when we're determining strength.</p>
<h2 id="weak-inductive-arguments">Weak Inductive Arguments</h2>
<p>While there are mathematical ways to determine probability, most of the time you'll have to use your intuition and experience to help you figure out whether an inductive argument is strong or weak. For example, the following is a weak inductive argument:</p>
<ol>
<li>This barrel contains one hundred apples</li>
<li>Three apples selected at random were found to be ripe</li>
<li>Therefore, probably all one hundred apples are ripe</li>
</ol>
<p>You did not have to use Bayesian mathematics to determine that. You can just kind of &quot;see&quot; that its weak. We also have an intuition on how to make it strong:</p>
<ol>
<li>This barrel contains one hundred apples</li>
<li>Eighty apples selected at random were found to be ripe</li>
<li>Therefore, probably all one hundred apples are ripe</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course these are clear cases and things get more difficult as you get closer to the center of the probability scale (would 50 inspected apples make the conclusion more or less probable?) but many times, you have a sense of where the argument lands on the scale.</p>
