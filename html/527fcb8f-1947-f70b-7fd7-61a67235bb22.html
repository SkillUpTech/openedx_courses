<p>Logic, as we have stated, is the study of the standards of correct reasoning. Logicians divide all arguments into two broad categories: deductive arguments and inductive arguments. Every argument, if clearly stated, can be classified as either deductive or inductive.</p>
<p>A <strong>deductive argument</strong> is put forward with the aim of proving its conclusion with complete certainty, in such a way that its conclusion must be true if its premises all are true. The author of a deductive argument (if sincere) intends to show conclusively, with complete certainty, that the conclusion must be true. An <strong>inductive argument</strong>, on the other hand, is put forward with a quite different goal in mind: An inductive argument is intended to show that its conclusion is probably or likely true, though not certainly true, if its premises all are true. The author of an inductive argument (if sincere) only aims to establish the intended conclusion with a high degree of probability although not with complete certainty.</p>
<p>The following arguments are deductive because each is intended to show conclusively that the conclusion must be true if the premises all are true:</p>
<p>Argument 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>All whales are mammals.</li>
<li>All mammals are animals.</li>
<li>Therefore, certainly all whales must be animals.</li>
</ol>
<p>Argument 2:</p>
<ol>
<li>Dinner will be tacos or dinner will be burritos.</li>
<li>It is not the case that dinner will be tacos.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is certain we’ll have burritos for dinner.</li>
</ol>
<p>Argument 3:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the roof leaks, then the ceiling leaks.</li>
<li>If the ceiling leaks, then the carpet gets wet.</li>
<li>So, surely if the roof leaks, then the carpet gets wet.</li>
</ol>
<p>In contrast, the following arguments are inductive because each aims to show only that the conclusion is probably, though not certainly, true:</p>
<p>Argument 4:</p>
<ol>
<li>In all of recorded history, it has never snowed in Seattle, Washington in June.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is highly probable, though not totally certain, that it won’t snow in Seattle next June.</li>
</ol>
<p>Argument 5:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Rolling Stones have sold out every concert they’ve given over the past fifty years.</li>
<li>Therefore, it is quite probable that their next concert will sell out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Argument 6:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has been raining for the past ten days.</li>
<li>All the weather reports predict more rain tomorrow.</li>
<li>Therefore, although it is not absolutely certain, it is reasonable to conclude that it will rain tomorrow.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="deductive-and-inductive-indicator-words">Deductive and Inductive Indicator Words</h2>
<p>If you are presenting an argument, and you want to make it crystal clear that your argument is deductive, place words in the conclusion that indicate the presence of deductive reasoning. Words such as must, necessarily, certainly, for sure, definitely, and absolutely indicate that you aim to conclusively establish your conclusion, in such a way that the conclusion must be true if the premises all are true. Notice that each deductive argument just given contains a deductive indicator word in its conclusion.</p>
<p>If you want to make it clear that your argument is inductive, use words in the conclusion that indicate the presence of inductive reasoning. Words such as “probably,” “likely,” and “it is reasonable to conclude” suggest that you intend your argument to show that the conclusion is probably, but not certainly, true, if the premises all are true. Each of the inductive arguments just given contains an inductive indicator word in its conclusion.</p>
