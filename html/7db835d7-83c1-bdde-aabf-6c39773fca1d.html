<p>As we saw in previous lessons, critical thinking for Socrates is a <em>life</em> skill--something we can apply every day in a variety of situations. But we can apply critical thinking skills specifically to problems in computer science and to the business of computer science. Earlier we looked at how logic and computer design fundamentals work in similar ways. In this lesson, we're going to explore how critical thinking skills can be applied <em>to</em> writing and testing computer programs.</p>
<h2 id="software-design">Software Design</h2>
<p>Software design is a large field and involves many disciplines. Microsoft has a course on software design which you can check out if you're interested here. While each discipline involved in software design has a specific and different role to play, each person involved should apply critical thinking skills to ensure consistency and that all scenarios are covered.</p>
<p>Since the Socratic method is about asking enough of the right questions about the topic at hand, here are some questions that you can ask when designing software from scratch or making updates to existing software. As you read through these, think about how they are an example of the Socratic method and how you can apply the Two Socratic Questions to get further clarity on the answers.</p>

<th>Question</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Who is the software for?</td>
<td>This question defines the audience you're building for and helps guide the design</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Who is outside of our audience?</td>
<td>Engineers call this a &quot;non-goal&quot; and it defines who the software is not meant to reach</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Why are <em>we</em> building this software</td>
<td>This may seem like an odd design question but it can force the team to think about the unique skills, abilities, and resources they bring to the table that will differentiate the software from others</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What should the software do/not do?</td>
<td>Similar to the questions about audience, these are high-level goal and non-goal questions that set boundaries for what you want the software to accomplish.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Does a program already exist to do this?</td>
<td>This is a great critical question because it calls the whole project into question.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What is the simplest design that accomplishes the goals?</td>
<td>This question specifically focuses on design goals and not adding more to the design than is absolutely necessary</td>

<p>These are just examples of the types of questions that software designers and engineers need to ask before and during the software development process.</p>
<h2 id="software-testing">Software Testing</h2>
<p>While the role &quot;Software Tester&quot; is less popular as it used to be (software engineers are now expected to do peer testing and use more automation), the <em>attitude</em> of the software tester should be one held by all software engineers.</p>
<p>When you put your testing hat on, you adopt a strongly critical perspective on the software you're building: you must assume there are flaws (known as &quot;bugs&quot;) in the software and your job is to find them. This may sound like a negative position to take but its actually an honest and <em>critical</em> one. All software has bugs so a good tester will seek to find as many as he or she can.</p>
