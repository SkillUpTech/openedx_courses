<p>Venn diagram for the A statement “All cats are mammals,”
looks like this:</p>
<img src="/static/VennAStatement.png" alt="Diagram showing the Venn Diagram for categorical A statements Image" title="">
<p>Here we shade region 1 to represent an empty set. Namely there are no cats that are not mammals -- that category is &quot;empty&quot; because our A statement tells us that everything that is a cat is also a mammal.</p>
<h3 id="the-e-statement">The 'E' Statement</h3>
<p>The corresponding universal negative or E statement in this case is understood as asserting, “Nothing is a cat and a mammal,” or “No cats are mammals.” The Venn diagram looks like this:</p>
<img src="/static/VennEStatement.png" alt="Diagram showing the Venn Diagram for categorical E statements Image" title="">
<p>In this diagram, we shade only region 2 or the area that overlaps both cats and mammals. We do not shade region 3 because we're not making any claims about the entire class of mammals. Our E statement only tells us that if something is a cat it is <em>not</em> a mammal. So that category is null or empty.</p>
