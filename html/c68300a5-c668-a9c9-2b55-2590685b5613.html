<p>Suppose Jan and Pat both have lunch at the school cafeteria. Later, in biology class, Jan gets sick, but Pat feels fine. The health department is again called in to investigate. Let us imagine that the information is compiled on the following table:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Salad</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Burrito</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Fried Rice</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Burger</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Sick after Lunch</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Jan</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Pat</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">X</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">--</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The only difference between their lunches was that Jan ate the burger and Pat skipped the burger plate. Otherwise, they ate the same food at lunch. The burger is the obvious suspect. Why? It is the one factor present when the effect (the sickness) is present and absent when the effect is absent, where the two cases are otherwise similar. In such a case, it is natural to conclude that the burger probably caused the sickness.</p>
<p>This reasoning embodies Mill’s <em>method of difference</em>, which states that if an effect E is present in one case and absent in a <em>closely similar case</em>, the difference (D) between the cases is probably the cause of E. D will be the circumstance or condition present when E occurs and absent when E doesn’t occur—provided that the cases compared are otherwise alike in all, or nearly all, relevant respects. Unlike the method of agreement, the method of difference identifies a probable <em>sufficient</em> condition of an effect.</p>
