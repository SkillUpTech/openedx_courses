<p>Because inductive arguments are about the content of what you're arguing, determining strength is more subjective than determining validity. Put another way, the strength of inductive arguments is not based on rules but on judgment.</p>
<p>Even so, this doesn't mean that there aren't guidelines we can follow to help us assess whether some claim is more probably true or more probably false. In this lesson, we'll look at some of these guidelines.</p>
<p>When attempting to determine the strength of an inductive argument, you will use background knowledge and experience along with your belief on how that background knowledge impacts the statement in question. While there are scientific tools to help with this (see for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem" title="" target="_blank">Bayes' Theorem</a>), most of the time, you'll need to make a judgement call. However, there are some general patterns you can discover that can help.</p>
<p>For example, there is a class of statements where less information actually increases the strength of an inductive argument--that is, makes it more probable. You can determine this without knowing anything about the original sample size.</p>
<p>In his excellent book <em>Thinking Fast and Slow</em>, Daniel Kahneman uses the following example to illustrate this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear demonstrations. Which is more probable?</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Linda is a bank teller.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>According to Kahneman, a study showed that the majority of people choose option 2 based on the description of the woman. But the general case is indeed more probable because the more relevant specificity (what you specify has to relate to what the claim is about) you add to this description, the less likely it is that a person will fit that description.</p>
<p>Put another way, there are more bank tellers in the world than there are bank tellers who also are in the feminist movement so without knowing anything more about Linda, it's more likely she'll be a part of the larger group. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunction_fallacy" title="" target="_blank">this Wikipedia article</a> for more details. Of course, this does assume some background knowledge but it doesn't require that you know specific numbers or percentages to determine which is more probable.</p>
<p>In other cases, going from a general to a specific increases the probability of an inductive argument. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>John is looking to buy a new home automation lock for his house. John has the following requirements: The lock has to work with MagicHouse, a new home automation hub, it has to match his home aesthetics, and should not require a lot of maintenance. His friend Beth owns a LokTite, an automated lock brand. Since LokTite works well for Beth, John believes it should work for him. Which makes John's belief more probable:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Beth uses a home automation system</p>
</li>
<li><p>Beth uses the MagicHouse hub in her home automation system</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In this example, because we learn that Beth uses the same automation hub that John uses--one of John's requirements--John's belief that LokTite will work is more probable given the information in statement 2. The additional information increases the probability that his belief will be true. This is because the original scenario specified what had to be true for John's belief to be true. Because we declare that this condition was met, the additional detail increases the probability that John's belief will be true.</p>
<p>Notice too that some additional propositions wouldn't affect the probability at all. Suppose your were told:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Beth's middle name is Jessica</li>
</ol>
<p>This would have no impact on the probability that John's belief is true because the additional information doesn't relate to John's belief in any way.</p>
<h2 id="modal-modifiers">Modal Modifiers</h2>
<p>In general, using the <em>modal</em> terms &quot;necessary&quot; or &quot;impossible&quot; (or their variants) will decrease the strength of an inductive argument (where &quot;necessary&quot; means it must be true without exception and &quot;impossible&quot; means it can't be true without exception). This is because necessary and impossible generally reduce the condition under which a statement can be true. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Marwa likes a lot of different kinds of ice cream. Marwa likes most of the &quot;standard&quot; flavors you can find at most place that sell ice cream. Given that information, are the following statements more or less probable:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li><p>Marwa likes vanilla ice cream</p>
</li>
<li><p>Marwa necessarily likes vanilla ice cream</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully you can intuitively see that statement 2 is less probable than statement 1. Because Marwa likes &quot;most&quot; of the standard flavors, we can't guarantee that she likes vanilla. It's probable but not necessarily true. Statement 2 says it would be impossible that Marwa not like vanilla. That's too strong and the probability that its true given our scenario is lower than claiming simply that she likes the flavor.</p>
<p>There are other factors that affect the strength of weakness of an inductive argument as well but the key thing to ask is whether the additional information you're being given make it more or less likely (or does it leave the probability unaffected) that the claim is probably true.</p>
