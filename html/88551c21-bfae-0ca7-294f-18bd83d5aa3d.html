<p>As the name implies, the conditional operator creates a compound statement that sets up a condition for something to be true. If the condition is met, the statement is true.</p>
<p><strong>Symbol</strong>:  ⊃ or →. On keyboards, you can use the greater than symbol for the horseshoe: &gt; or two dashes and the greater than symbol for the arrow: --&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Symbol Name</strong>: Horseshoe or arrow</p>
<p><strong>Parts of Conditional</strong>: Two simple statements joined by the conditional symbol. The first simple statement in a conditional is called the <strong>antecedent</strong> and the second simple statement is called the <strong>consequent</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong>: For the two simple statements &quot;Ann is home&quot; (A) and &quot;Bob is home&quot; (B) a conditional would look like this:</p>
<p>A ⊃ B (A → B) or IF Ann is home THEN Bob is home. Note that the simple statements do not include the IF and the THEN--those are the operator keywords.</p>
<h2 id="more-on-conditionals">More on conditionals</h2>
<p>Conditionals provide us with some interesting logical relationships. Remember that conditionals are not arguments in and of themselves but can make up premises (or parts of premises) of an argument. Conditionals do tell us though what must <em>necessarily</em> be true if something else is true: it tells us that if the antecedent is true, the consequent <em>must be</em> true.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at these relationships in the next lesson.</p>
